	abstract = {Phytohormones are small chemicals critical for plant development and adaptation to a changing environment. Strigolactones (SLs), carotenoid-derived small signalling molecules and a class of phytohormones, regulate multiple developmental processes and respond to diverse environmental signals. SLs also coordinate adjustments in the balance of resource distribution by strategic modification of the plant development, allowing plants to adapt to nutrient deficiency. Instead of operating independently, SL interplays with abscisic acid, cytokinin, auxin, ethylene, and some other plant phytohormones, forming elaborate signalling networks. Hormone signalling crosstalk in plant development and environmental response may occur in a fully concerted manner or as a cascade of sequential events. In many cases, the exact underlying mechanism is unclear because of the different effects of phytohormones and the varying backgrounds of their actions. In this review, we systematically summarise the synthesis, signal transduction, and biological functions of SLs and further highlight the significance of crosstalk between SLs and other phytohormones during plant development and resistance to ever-changing environments.},

@article{Morellato2016,
	abstract = {Phenology has achieved a prominent position in current scenarios of global change research given its role in monitoring and predicting the timing of recurrent life cycle events. However, the implications of phenology to environmental conservation and management remain poorly explored. Here, we present the first explicit appraisal of how phenology --- a multidisciplinary science encompassing biometeorology, ecology, and evolutionary biology --- can make a key contribution to contemporary conservation biology. We focus on shifts in plant phenology induced by global change, their impacts on species diversity and plant--animal interactions in the tropics, and how conservation efforts could be enhanced in relation to plant resource organization. We identify the effects of phenological changes and mismatches in the maintenance and conservation of mutualistic interactions, and examine how phenological research can contribute to evaluate, manage and mitigate the consequences of land-use change and other natural and anthropogenic disturbances, such as fire, exotic and invasive species. We also identify cutting-edge tools that can improve the spatial and temporal coverage of phenological monitoring, from satellites to drones and digital cameras. We highlight the role of historical information in recovering long-term phenological time series, and track climate-related shifts in tropical systems. Finally, we propose a set of measures to boost the contribution of phenology to conservation science. We advocate the inclusion of phenology into predictive models integrating evolutionary history to identify species groups that are either resilient or sensitive to future climate-change scenarios, and understand how phenological mismatches can affect community dynamics, ecosystem services, and conservation over time.},

@article{Silvestro2019,
	abstract = {Forest managers use artificial regeneration to influence tree species composition and productivity. The selection of plant material could assume a leading role in forest planning, mainly when aiming to increase the adaptation of stands within a context of climate change. In this study, we investigated the timing of bud burst and bud set in five black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] ecotypes growing in a common garden and originating from a latitudinal range in the boreal forest of Qu{\'e}bec, Canada. Bud phenology was monitored weekly during the 2015, 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. On average, the bud burst process lasted 23 days, occurring 1.2 days later for each degree Celsius of increase in mean annual temperature at the provenance site. Bud set duration was 55 days and occurred 1.8 days later for each degree Celsius of increase in mean annual temperature at the provenance site. We demonstrated that both bud burst and bud set occurred earlier in individuals from colder sites, which resulted in similar lengths of the growing season among provenances. This clinal variation in the timings of growth resumption and cessation confirms the ecotypic differentiation of black spruce populations and reflects a long-lasting adaptation to the local temperatures in the sites of origin. The findings of this study demonstrate that ecotype selection in black spruce can aim to avoid damage from either early or late frosts, but not both.},

@article{Denny2014,
	abstract = {Phenology offers critical insights into the responses of species to climate change; shifts in species'phenologies can result in disruptions to the ecosystem processes and services upon which human livelihood depends. To better detect such shifts, scientists need long-term phenological records covering many taxa and across a broad geographic distribution. To date, phenological observation efforts across the USA have been geographically limited and have used different methods, making comparisons across sites and species difficult. To facilitate coordinated cross-site, cross-species, and geographically extensive phenological monitoring across the nation, the USA National Phenology Network has developed in situ monitoring protocols standardized across taxonomic groups and ecosystem types for terrestrial, freshwater, and marine plant and animal taxa. The protocols include elements that allow enhanced detection and description of phenological responses, including assessment of phenological ``status'', or the ability to track presence--absence of a particular phenophase, as well as standards for documenting the degree to which phenological activity is expressed in terms of intensity or abundance. Data collected by this method can be integrated with historical phenology data sets, enabling the development of databases for spatial and temporal assessment of changes in status and trends of disparate organisms. To build a common, spatially, and temporally extensive multi-taxa phenological data set available for a variety of research and science applications, we encourage scientists, resources managers, and others conducting ecological monitoring or research to consider utilization of these standardized protocols for tracking the seasonal activity of plants and animals.},

@article{Meng2022,
	abstract = {{Artificial light at night (ALAN), an increasing anthropogenic driver, is widespread and shows rapid expansion with potential adverse impact on the terrestrial ecosystem. However, whether and to what extent does ALAN affect plant phenology, a critical factor influencing the timing of terrestrial ecosystem processes, remains unexplored due to limited ALAN observation. Here, we used the Black Marble ALAN product and phenology observations from USA National Phenology Network to investigate the impact of ALAN on deciduous woody plants phenology in the conterminous United States. We found that (1) ALAN significantly advanced the date of breaking leaf buds by 8.9 $\pm$ 6.9 days (mean $\pm$ SD) and delayed the coloring of leaves by 6.0 $\pm$ 11.9 days on average; (2) the magnitude of phenological changes was significantly correlated with the intensity of ALAN (P \\&lt; 0.001); and (3) there was an interaction between ALAN and temperature on the coloring of leaves, but not on breaking leaf buds. We further showed that under future climate warming scenarios, ALAN will accelerate the advance in breaking leaf buds but exert a more complex effect on the coloring of leaves. This study suggests intensified ALAN may have far-reaching but underappreciated consequences in disrupting key ecosystem functions and services, which requires an interdisciplinary approach to investigate. Developing lighting strategies that minimize the impact of ALAN on ecosystems, especially those embedded and surrounding major cities, is challenging but must be pursued.}},

@article{Vitasse2021,
	abstract = {Summary Microclimatic effects (light, temperature) are often neglected in phenological studies and little information is known about the impact of resource availability (nutrient and water) on tree's phenological cycles. Here we experimentally studied spring and autumn phenology in four temperate trees in response to changes in bud albedo (white-painted vs black-painted buds), light conditions (nonshaded vs c. 70\% shaded), water availability (irrigated, control and reduced precipitation) and nutrients (low vs high availability). We found that higher bud albedo or shade delayed budburst (up to +12 d), indicating that temperature is sensed locally within each bud. Leaf senescence was delayed by high nutrient availability (up to +7 d) and shade conditions (up to +39 d) in all species, except oak. Autumn phenological responses to summer droughts depended on species, with a delay for cherry (+7 d) and an advance for beech (−7 d). The strong phenological effects of bud albedo and light exposure reveal an important role of microclimatic variation on phenology. In addition to the temperature and photoperiod effects, our results suggest a tight interplay between source and sink processes in regulating the end of the seasonal vegetation cycle, which can be largely influenced by resource availability (light, water and nutrients).},

@article{Laigle2021,
	abstract = {Linking climate variability and change to the phenological response of species is particularly challenging in the context of mountainous terrain. In these environments, elevation and topography lead to a diversity of bioclimatic conditions at fine scales affecting species distribution and phenology. In order to quantify in situ climate conditions for mountain plants, the CREA (Research Center for Alpine Ecosystems) installed 82 temperature stations throughout the southwestern Alps, at different elevations and aspects. Dataloggers at each station provide local measurements of temperature at four heights (5 cm below the soil surface, at the soil surface, 30 cm above the soil surface, and 2 m above ground). Given the significant amount of effort required for station installation and maintenance, we tested whether meteorological data based on the S2M reanalysis could be used instead of station data. Comparison of the two datasets showed that some climate indices, including snow melt-out date and a heat wave index, can vary significantly according to data origin. More general indices such as daily temperature averages were more consistent across datasets, while threshold-based temperature indices showed somewhat lower agreement. Over a 12 year period, the phenological responses of four mountain tree species (ash (Fraxinus excelsior), spruce (Picea abies), hazel (Corylus avellana), birch (Betula pendula)), coal tits (Periparus ater) and common frogs (Rana temporaria) to climate variability were better explained, from both a statistical and ecological standpoint, by indices derived from field stations. Reanalysis data out-performed station data, however, for predicting larch (Larix decidua) budburst date. Overall, our study indicates that the choice of dataset for phenological monitoring ultimately depends on target bioclimatic variables and species, and also on the spatial and temporal scale of the study.},

Based on the strong statistical association between phenology and temperature phenological observations provide an inexpensive means for the temporal and spatial analysis of the urban heat island. However, other environmental factors might also weaken this relationship. In addition, the investigation of urban phenology allows an estimation of future phenology from current information since cities with their amplified temperatures may serve as a proxy for future conditions. Nevertheless, the design of spatial compared to long-term studies might be influenced by different factors which should be taken into consideration when interpreting results from a specific study.

Supra-optimal temperatures could be more prevalent under future climate-change scenarios, but data sets in this study contained few data in that range.},

	n2 = {Thermal time (TT) is an agro-climate index widely established and used in predicting plant development based on temperature. This index is a powerful tool for measuring multi-faceted changes in temperature occurring from climate change. In the present study, TT was calculated for the entire frost-free period and individual spring, summer, and fall seasons using growing degree day (GDD), general thermal index (GTI), crop heat unit (CHU), and heat stress degree day (HSDD) models for 1054 counties across 12 Midwest states on a daily basis from 1950 to 2017. The temporal trend for each county was fit with a linear regression model for percent change per year. During the frost-free period, warming occurred in 260 to 489 counties with 0.06 to 0.34{\%} gain per year dependent on model and county selected. Warming has occurred in northern and eastern counties primarily from gains in the fall season and partially from the spring. These TT gains are from additional calendar days from an expanded frost-free period and secondarily from a change in maximum temperature (fall only). Heat stress (>30$\,^{\circ}$C) during the frost-free period has decreased for 212 counties in the west-central region. Overall, the CHU model detected the most counties warming and had the lowest error particularly compared to the GDD model. Compared to 1950, some counties showed up to 1.2-fold increase in frost-free TT and are projected to 1.8-fold by end of the 21st century. Current warming trends are related to projected TT trends such that adaptation planning can be guided by the trajectory from the past 68 yr. Core Ideas Northern and eastern counties in the Midwest have up to 1.2-fold increase in frost-free thermal time since 1950 while central and southern counties do not. The growing degree day model results in fewer counties detected and lower rates of warming compared to the general thermal index and crop heat unit models. The gain in thermal time is primarily from the fall season and secondarily from the spring.},

The physiological and mathematical bases upon which they are founded are, however, sometimes forgotten, resulting in questionable interpretations. Such is particularly the case for anything relating to variations in the temperature thresholds which enter into the calculation of these degree.day sums. Without seeking to draw up a synthesis of the extremely numerous works published in the field, this review article sets out to present the basic principles of the degree.day unit notion as well as the limits of its use. On this last point, we will particularly emphasise the influence of the non-linearity of the temperature response of the method used in determining the threshold temperature as well as the pertinence of the temperature taken into account in studying the phenomenon. Several practical conclusions are drawn from this review article.},

	abstract = {Abstract Concerns are rising about the capacity of species to adapt quickly enough to climate change. In long-lived organisms such as trees, genetic adaptation is slow, and how much phenotypic plasticity can help them cope with climate change remains largely unknown. Here, we assess whether, where and when phenological plasticity is and will be adaptive in three major European tree species. We use a process-based species distribution model, parameterized with extensive ecological data, and manipulate plasticity to suppress phenological variations due to interannual, geographical and trend climate variability, under current and projected climatic conditions. We show that phenological plasticity is not always adaptive and mostly affects fitness at the margins of the species' distribution and climatic niche. Under current climatic conditions, phenological plasticity constrains the northern range limit of oak and beech and the southern range limit of pine. Under future climatic conditions, phenological plasticity becomes strongly adaptive towards the trailing edges of beech and oak, but severely constrains the range and niche of pine. Our results call for caution when interpreting geographical variation in trait means as adaptive, and strongly point towards species distribution models explicitly taking phenotypic plasticity into account when forecasting species distribution under climate change scenarios.},

@article{Vico2021,
	abstract = {In Northern Europe, poplars (Populus) can provide biomass for energy and material use, but most available clones were developed for lower latitudes and are unlikely to be well adapted to higher latitudes, even under warmer climates. We thus need to understand how clones respond to climatic conditions and photoperiod, and how these responses can be predicted. We answer these questions exploiting leaf phenological data of Populus clones, grown in six sites across the Baltic region, in Northern Europe, for 2 years with contrasting climatic conditions. Regarding the effects of climatic conditions and photoperiod, within each site, higher temperatures advanced the timing and enhanced the speed of spring and autumn phenology, but reduced the effective growing season length. Across sites, latitude affected the timing of spring and autumn phenology, the speed of spring phenology, and the effective growing season length; clone affected only the timing of phenology. Regarding the predictability of clone response to growing conditions, the growing degree day (GDD) model could not predict spring phenology, because the growing degree day threshold for a specific phenological stage was not only clone-, but also latitude- and year-specific. Yet, this GDD threshold allowed a robust ranking of clones across sites and years, thus providing a tool to determine the relative differences across clones, independently of latitude and temperature. A similar, but not as strong, pattern was observed in the timing of spring and autumn phenological stages. Hence, while prediction of spring phenology remains elusive, the ranking of clones based on observations of their phenology in a single location can provide useful indications on the clones'relative performance under different latitudes and climates.},

Data were collected over a 6-day period (from 25 March to 1 April, 2010), during which the equipment was monitored continuously and simultaneously. We employed the following combinations of equipment and conditions: a HOBO data logger in full sunlight; a HOBO data logger shielded within a white plastic cup with windows for air circulation; a HOBO data logger shielded within a gill-type shelter (multi-plate prototype plastic); a copper-constantan thermocouple psychrometer exposed to natural ventilation and protected from sunlight; and a temperature/relative humidity probe under a commercial, multi-plate radiation shield. Comparisons between the measurements obtained with the various devices were made on the basis of statistical indicators: linear regression, with coefficient of determination; index of agreement; maximum absolute error; and mean absolute error. The prototype multi-plate shelter (gill-type) used in order to protect the HOBO data logger was found to provide the best protection against the effects of solar radiation on measurements of temperature and relative humidity. The precision and accuracy of a device that measures temperature and relative humidity depend on an efficient shelter that minimizes the interference caused by solar radiation, thereby avoiding erroneous analysis of the data obtained.},

	abstract = {A heterogeneous patchwork mosaic of soil, vegetation, and built surfaces that result from a variety of urban land uses cause urban microclimates within cities. We studied the seasonal relationships of land use, urban plant cover and microclimate in Phoenix, Arizona, USA, metropolitan. Early morning (0500 HR) and afternoon (1500 HR) near-surface temperatures and humidities were measured along multiple transects in this desert city and outlying areas during June and December 1999. A Landsat thematic mapper normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) image was used to quantify spatial patterns of plant density. Land use had the most pronounced effect on microclimate during the early morning hours of summer. Agricultural and residential land uses had the highest relative humidities, dew point temperatures, and NDVI, and the lowest air temperatures. Commercial and industrial land uses had highest temperatures and lowest NDVI. Temperatures were generally negatively correlated to NDVI, while humidity and dew point temperatures were generally positively correlated to NDVI. Distance from the urban core did not affect NDVI but had a significant negative effect on adjusted air temperature. In addition, a historical comparison of land use, NDVI and microclimate data collected during 1976 and again during 1999 along two transects revealed overall decreases in NDVI and relative increases in air temperature indicative of urban expansion. These findings show that microclimates in this desert city are caused by more than just variations in plant cover, and are likely an interactive effect of vegetation density and other non-vegetative urban surfaces.},

@article{Luedeling2011,
	abstract = {Background Temperate fruit and nut trees require adequate winter chill to produce economically viable yields. Global warming has the potential to reduce available winter chill and greatly impact crop yields.   Methodology/Principal Findings We estimated winter chill for two past (1975 and 2000) and 18 future scenarios (mid and end 21st century; 3 Global Climate Models [GCMs]; 3 greenhouse gas emissions [GHG] scenarios). For 4,293 weather stations around the world and GCM projections, Safe Winter Chill (SWC), the amount of winter chill that is exceeded in 90% of all years, was estimated for all scenarios using the ``Dynamic Model'' and interpolated globally. We found that SWC ranged between 0 and about 170 Chill Portions (CP) for all climate scenarios, but that the global distribution varied across scenarios. Warm regions are likely to experience severe reductions in available winter chill, potentially threatening production there. In contrast, SWC in most temperate growing regions is likely to remain relatively unchanged, and cold regions may even see an increase in SWC. Climate change impacts on SWC differed quantitatively among GCMs and GHG scenarios, with the highest GHG leading to losses up to 40 CP in warm regions, compared to 20 CP for the lowest GHG.   Conclusions/Significance The extent of projected changes in winter chill in many major growing regions of fruits and nuts indicates that growers of these commodities will likely experience problems in the future. Mitigation of climate change through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can help reduce the impacts, however, adaption to changes will have to occur. To better prepare for likely impacts of climate change, efforts should be undertaken to breed tree cultivars for lower chilling requirements, to develop tools to cope with insufficient winter chill, and to better understand the temperature responses of tree crops.},

@article{Asse2018,
	abstract = {Mountain regions are particularly susceptible and influenced by the effects of climate change. In the Alps, temperature increased two times faster than in the Northern Hemisphere during the 20th century. As an immediate response in certain tree species, spring phenological phases, such as budburst and flowering, have tended to occur earlier. However, recent studies have shown a slowing down of phenological shifts during the last two decades compared to earlier periods, which might be caused by warmer winters. Indeed, cold temperatures are required to break bud dormancy that occurs in early fall; and dormancy break is a prerequisite for cell elongation to take place in spring when temperature conditions are warm enough. Here we aimed at evaluating the effects of winter warming vs. spring warming on the phenological shift along mountain elevation gradients. We tested the hypothesis that a lack of chilling temperature during winter delayed dormancy release and subsequently spring phenological phases. For this, we used eight years of temperature and phenological records for five tree species (Betula pendula, Fraxinus excelsior, Corylus avellana, Picea abies and Larix decidua) gathered with the citizen science program Phenoclim (www.phenoclim.org) deployed over the French Alps. Our results showed that for similar preseason (i.e. after dormancy break) temperatures, warmer winters significantly delayed budburst and flowering along the elevation gradient (+0.9 to +5.6 days $\,^{\circ}$C−1) except for flowering of Corylus and budburst of Picea. For similar cold winter temperatures, warmer preseasons significantly advanced budburst and flowering along the elevation gradient (−5.3 to −8.4 days $\,^{\circ}$C−1). On average, the effect of winter warming was 2.3 times lower than the effect of spring warming. We also showed that warmer winter temperature conditions have a significantly larger effect at lower elevations. As a consequence, the observed delaying effect of winter warming might be beneficial to trees by reducing the risk of exposure to late spring frost on a short term. This could further lead to partial dormancy break at lower elevations before the end of the 21st century, which, in turn, may alter bud development and flowering and so tree fitness.},

	abstract = {We used data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in association with county-level data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop empirical models predicting maize and soybean yield in the Central United States. As part of our analysis we also tested the ability of MODIS to capture inter-annual variability in yields. Our results show that the MODIS two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) provides a better basis for predicting maize yields relative to the widely used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Inclusion of information related to crop phenology derived from MODIS significantly improved model performance within and across years. Surprisingly, using moderate spatial resolution data from the MODIS Land Cover Type product to identify agricultural areas did not degrade model results relative to using higher-spatial resolution crop-type maps developed by the USDA. Correlations between vegetation indices and yield were highest 65--75 days after greenup for maize and 80 days after greenup for soybeans. EVI2 was the best index for predicting maize yield in non-semi-arid counties (R2=0.67), but the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) performed better in semi-arid counties (R2=0.69), probably because the NDWI is sensitive to irrigation in semi-arid areas with low-density agriculture. NDVI and EVI2 performed equally well predicting soybean yield (R2=0.69 and 0.70, respectively). In addition, EVI2 was best able to capture large negative anomalies in maize yield in 2005 (R2=0.73). Overall, our results show that using crop phenology and a combination of EVI2 and NDWI have significant benefit for remote sensing-based maize and soybean yield models.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
Spring phenology is a key phenomenon mediating the effects of climate change on terrestrial plants and ecosystems, but in regard to subtropical trees, the dormancy mechanisms that regulate spring phenology are still poorly understood. It has been suggested recently that similarly to temperate and boreal trees, subtropical tree species also show endodormancy and a chilling requirement of endodormancy release. However, there are no previous experimental results on the chilling temperature range that is effective for endodormancy release in subtropical trees. We studied endodormancy and the chilling requirement in four subtropical tree species experimentally. In addition to chilling in natural conditions, we applied controlled chilling at several constant temperatures ranging from -2 to +15 $\,^{\circ}$C. Our results show endodormancy and a chilling requirement in the tree species studied and reveal several differences among the four species in the manifestation and depth of endodormancy. Most importantly, our findings indicate that contrary to the prevailing mainline conception that chilling temperatures are generally restricted to those below +10 $\,^{\circ}$C, higher temperatures of up to +15 $\,^{\circ}$C are also effective for endodormancy release in the subtropical tree species examined. An exact upper threshold of +10.4 $\,^{\circ}$C has been experimentally established for boreal Betula pubescens. We hypothesized that this difference would be explained by differences in the occurrence of low autumn temperatures between the two respective climates. We developed a method for testing the hypothesis by analysing long-term climatic records in relation to the experimental findings. Tentative results supported our hypothesis. On the basis of this novel result, we put forward the testable generalized hypothesis that in any climatic conditions where trees show endodormancy, the range of temperatures physiologically effective in endodormancy release represents the range of typical autumn air temperatures occurring in those particular climatic conditions.},

@article{Baumgarten2021,
	abstract = {Summary Over the last decades, spring leaf-out of temperate and boreal trees has substantially advanced in response to global warming, affecting terrestrial biogeochemical fluxes and the Earth's climate system. However, it remains unclear whether leaf-out will continue to advance with further warming because species' effective chilling temperatures, as well as the amount of chilling time required to break dormancy, are still largely unknown for most forest tree species. Here, we assessed the progress of winter dormancy and quantified the efficiency of different chilling temperatures in six dominant temperate European tree species by exposing 1170 twig cuttings to a range of temperatures from −2$\,^{\circ}$C to 10$\,^{\circ}$C for 1, 3, 6 or 12 wk. We found that freezing temperatures were most effective for half of the species or as effective as chilling temperatures up to 10$\,^{\circ}$C, that is, leading to minimum thermal time to and maximum success of budburst. Interestingly, chilling duration had a much larger effect on dormancy release than absolute chilling temperature. Our experimental results challenge the common assumption that optimal chilling temperatures range c. 4--6$\,^{\circ}$C, instead revealing strong sensitivity to a large range of temperatures. These findings are valuable for improving phenological models and predicting future spring phenology in a warming world.},

For three species, data were augmented by herbarium dates for 140-year-long time series. We further meta-analysed 107 temperate-zone woody species in which leaf-out cues have been studied, half of them also monitored here. Southern climate--adapted species flushed significantly later than natives, and photoperiod- and chilling- sensitive species all flushed late. The herbarium method revealed the extent of species-specific climate tracking. Our results forecast that: (1) a northward expansion of southern species due to climate warming will increase the number of late flushers in the north, counteracting documented and expected flushing time advances; and (2) photoperiod- and chilling-sensitive woody species cannot rapidly track climate warming.},

@article{Lembrechts2019,
	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) have rapidly evolved into one of the most widely used tools to answer a broad range of ecological questions, from the effects of climate change to challenges for species management. Current SDMs and their predictions under anthropogenic climate change are, however, often based on free-air or synoptic temperature conditions with a coarse resolution, and thus fail to capture apparent temperature (cf. microclimate) experienced by living organisms within their habitats. Yet microclimate operates as soon as a habitat can be characterized by a vertical component (e.g. forests, mountains, or cities) or by horizontal variation in surface cover. The mismatch between how we usually express climate (cf. coarse-grained free-air conditions) and the apparent microclimatic conditions that living organisms experience has only recently been acknowledged in SDMs, yet several studies have already made considerable progress in tackling this problem from different angles. In this review, we summarize the currently available methods to obtain meaningful microclimatic data for use in distribution modelling. We discuss the issue of extent and resolution, and propose an integrated framework using a selection of appropriately-placed sensors in combination with both the detailed measurements of the habitat 3D structure, for example derived from digital elevation models or airborne laser scanning, and the long-term records of free-air conditions from weather stations. As such, we can obtain microclimatic data with a relevant spatiotemporal resolution and extent to dynamically model current and future species distributions.},

@article{Lenoir2013,
	abstract = {Abstract Recent studies from mountainous areas of small spatial extent (<2500 km2) suggest that fine-grained thermal variability over tens or hundreds of metres exceeds much of the climate warming expected for the coming decades. Such variability in temperature provides buffering to mitigate climate-change impacts. Is this local spatial buffering restricted to topographically complex terrains? To answer this, we here study fine-grained thermal variability across a 2500-km wide latitudinal gradient in Northern Europe encompassing a large array of topographic complexities. We first combined plant community data, Ellenberg temperature indicator values, locally measured temperatures (LmT) and globally interpolated temperatures (GiT) in a modelling framework to infer biologically relevant temperature conditions from plant assemblages within <1000-m2 units (community-inferred temperatures: CiT). We then assessed: (1) CiT range (thermal variability) within 1-km2 units; (2) the relationship between CiT range and topographically and geographically derived predictors at 1-km resolution; and (3) whether spatial turnover in CiT is greater than spatial turnover in GiT within 100-km2 units. Ellenberg temperature indicator values in combination with plant assemblages explained 46--72\% of variation in LmT and 92--96\% of variation in GiT during the growing season (June, July, August). Growing-season CiT range within 1-km2 units peaked at 60--65$\,^{\circ}$N and increased with terrain roughness, averaging 1.97 $\,^{\circ}$C (SD = 0.84 $\,^{\circ}$C) and 2.68 $\,^{\circ}$C (SD = 1.26 $\,^{\circ}$C) within the flattest and roughest units respectively. Complex interactions between topography-related variables and latitude explained 35\% of variation in growing-season CiT range when accounting for sampling effort and residual spatial autocorrelation. Spatial turnover in growing-season CiT within 100-km2 units was, on average, 1.8 times greater (0.32 $\,^{\circ}$C km−1) than spatial turnover in growing-season GiT (0.18 $\,^{\circ}$C km−1). We conclude that thermal variability within 1-km2 units strongly increases local spatial buffering of future climate warming across Northern Europe, even in the flattest terrains.},

A network of 90 temperature sensors was deployed inside grapevine canopies of this area and temperatures were measured from 2012 through 2018. To determine the effect of temperature on vine development, the phenological stages (budbreak, flowering, and v{\'e}raison) were recorded on 60 reference plots planted with Vitis vinifera L. cv. Merlot located near the temperature sensors. Results showed great spatial variability in temperature, especially minimum temperature, with an amplitude of up to 10$\,^{\circ}$C on a given day. The spatial variability of the Winkler index measured in the canopy inside a given vintage was around 320 degree-days. This research explores the main factors affecting spatial variability in temperature, such as environmental factors and meteorological conditions. The impact of temperature on vine behavior was also analyzed. Observed phenological dates were compared to those estimated using the Grapevine Flowering V{\'e}raison model. Maps of temperatures and phenological observations were created over this area and provided a useful tool for improved adaptation of plant material and training systems to local temperature variability and change.},

	abstract = {Abstract Urban landscapes are increasingly recognized as providing important ecosystem services (ES) to their occupants. Yet, urban ES assessments often ignore the complex spatial heterogeneity and land-use history of cities. Soil-based services may be particularly susceptible to land-use legacy effects. We studied indicators of three soil-based ES, carbon storage, water quality regulation, and runoff regulation, in a historically agricultural urban landscape and asked (1) How do ES indicators vary with contemporary land cover and time since development? (2) Do ES indicators vary primarily among land-cover classes, within land-cover classes, or within sites? (3) What is the relative contribution of urban land-cover classes to potential citywide ES provision? We measured biophysical indicators (soil carbon [C], available phosphorus [P], and saturated hydraulic conductivity [Ks]) in 100 sites across five land-cover classes, spanning an ~125-year gradient of time since development within each land-cover class. Potential for ES provision was substantial in urban green spaces, including developed land. Runoff regulation services (high Ks) were highest in forests; water quality regulation (low P) was highest in open spaces and grasslands; and open spaces and developed land (e.g., residential yards) had the highest C storage. In developed land covers, both C and P increased with time since development, indicating effects of historical land-use on contemporary ES and trade-offs between two important ES. Among-site differences accounted for a high proportion of variance in soil properties in forests, grasslands, and open space, while residential areas had high within-site variability, underscoring the leverage city residents have to improve urban ES provision. Developed land covers contributed most ES supply at the citywide scale, even after accounting for potential impacts of impervious surfaces. Considering the full mosaic of urban green space and its history is needed to estimate the kinds and magnitude of ES provided in cities, and to augment regional ES assessments that often ignore or underestimate urban ES supply.},

Despite recent advances identifying the molecular basis of temperature responses, few studies have incorporated this knowledge into predictive models. Here we develop a method to forecast flowering phenology by modelling regulatory dynamics of key flowering-time genes in perennial life cycles. The model, parameterized by controlled laboratory experiments, accurately reproduces the seasonal changes in gene expression, the corresponding timing of floral initiation and return to vegetative growth after a period of flowering in complex natural environments. A striking scenario forecast by the model under climate warming is that the shift in the return time to vegetative growth is greater than that in floral initiation, which results in a significant reduction of the flowering period. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of gene expression assessment to predict unexplored risks of climate change.},

All individuals were genotyped at 13 microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and 70 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 24 candidate genes potentially involved in stress response and phenology. Both SSR and SNP markers revealed high genetic diversity in the studied populations and low but statistically significant population differentiation. The SNPs were searched for FST outliers using three different methods implemented in LOSITAN, Arlequin, and BayeScan, respectively. Additionally, associations of the SNPs with environmental variables were tested by two methods implemented in Bayenv2 and Samβada, respectively. There were 14 (20{\%}) SNPs in 12 (50{\%}) candidate genes in the saplings and 9 (12.8{\%}) SNPs in 7 (29.2{\%}) candidate genes in the adults consistently identified by at least two of the five methods used, indicating that they are very likely under selection. Genes with SNPs showing signatures of selection are involved in a wide range of molecular functions, such as oxidoreductases (IDH), hydrolases (CysPro), transferases (XTH), transporters (KT2), chaperones (CP10), and transcription factors (DAG, NAC transcription factor). The obtained data will help us better understand the genetic variation underlying adaptation to environmentally changing conditions in European beech, which is of great importance for the development of scientific guidelines for the sustainable management and conservation of this important species.},

@article{Zhao2012,
	abstract = { Plants interact to the seasonality of their environments, and changes in plant phenology have long been regarded as sensitive indicators of climatic change. Plant phenology modeling has been shown to be the simplest and most useful tool to assess phenol--climate shifts. Temperature, solar radiation, and water availability are assumed to be the key factors that control plant phenology. Statistical, mechanistic, and theoretical approaches have often been used for the parameterization of plant phenology models. The statistical approaches correlate the timing of phenological events to environmental factors or heat unit accumulations. The approaches have the simplified calculation procedures, correct phenological mechanism assumptions, but limited applications and predictive abilities. The mechanistic approaches describe plant phenology with the known or assumed ``cause--effect relationships'' between biological processes and key driving variables. The mechanistic approaches have the improved parameter processes, realistic assumptions, broad applications, and effective predictions. The theoretical approaches assume cost--benefit tradeoff strategies in trees. These methods are capable of capturing and quantifying the potential impacts and consequences of global climate change and human activity. However, certain limitations still exist related to our understanding of phenological mechanisms in relation to (1) interactions between plants and their specific climates, (2) the integration of both field observational and remote sensing data with plant phenology models across taxa and ecosystem type, (3) amplitude clarification of scale-related sensitivity to global climate change, and (4) improvements in parameterization processes and the overall reduction of modeling uncertainties to forecast impacts of future climate change on plant phenological dynamics. To improve our capacity in the prediction of the amplitude of plant phenological responses with regard to both structural and functional sensitivity to future global climate change, it is important to refine modeling methodologies by applying long-term and large-scale observational data. It is equally important to consider other less used but critical factors (such as heredity, pests, and anthropogenic drivers), apply advanced model parameterization and data assimilation techniques, incorporate process-based plant phenology models as a dynamic component into global vegetation dynamic models, and test plant phenology models against long-term ground observations and high-resolution satellite data across different spatial and temporal scales. },

	abstract = {Abstract Phenology, the timing of cyclical and seasonal natural phenomena such as flowering and leaf out, is an integral part of ecological systems with impacts on human activities like environmental management, tourism, and agriculture. As a result, there are numerous potential applications for actionable predictions of when phenological events will occur. However, despite the availability of phenological data with large spatial, temporal, and taxonomic extents, and numerous phenology models, there have been no automated species-level forecasts of plant phenology. This is due in part to the challenges of building a system that integrates large volumes of climate observations and forecasts, uses that data to fit models and make predictions for large numbers of species, and consistently disseminates the results of these forecasts in interpretable ways. Here, we describe a new near-term phenology-forecasting system that makes predictions for the timing of budburst, flowers, ripe fruit, and fall colors for 78 species across the United States up to 6 months in advance and is updated every four days. We use the lessons learned in developing this system to provide guidance developing large-scale near-term ecological forecast systems more generally, to help advance the use of automated forecasting in ecology.},

	abstract = {Ecology Letters (2012) Abstract Shifts in species' phenology in response to climate change have wide-ranging consequences for ecological systems. However, significant variability in species' responses, together with limited data, frustrates efforts to forecast the consequences of ongoing phenological changes. Herein, we use a case study of three North American plant communities to explore the implications of variability across levels of organisation (within and among species, and among communities) for forecasting responses to climate change. We show how despite significant variation among species in sensitivities to climate, comparable patterns emerge at the community level once regional climate drivers are accounted for. However, communities differ with respect to projected patterns of divergence and overlap among their species' phenological distributions in response to climate change. These analyses and a review of hypotheses suggest how explicit consideration of spatial scale and levels of biological organisation may help to understand and forecast phenological responses to climate change.},

@article{Schwartz2013a,
	abstract = {Vegetative canopies play a crucial role in the energy balance and composition of the atmospheric boundary layer via biotic control over evapotranspiration and carbon sources/sinks. Accurately predicting the onset/increase of carbon uptake/transpiration during the spring leaf development period using coarse resolution tower-based and satellite-derived data alone is difficult. Thus, understanding stand-level spatial patterns of spring plant phenological development and the processes that drive them may be crucial for improving landscape level estimates of evapotranspiration and carbon accumulation. In this study, high-resolution spatial and temporal tree phenology data were recorded in field campaigns over approximately 5 weeks during spring 2006 and 2007 (within a 625m×275m area), and over similar periods during spring 2008, 2009, and 2010 (within two 625m×625m areas) near the WLEF eddy covariance flux tower site near Park Falls in northern Wisconsin. Our findings demonstrate that phenological variations between individual trees in a specific microclimate can be adequately represented with a sample of 30 or more individuals. Further, visual phenological observations can be generally related to under-canopy light levels, and for spring phenology measurements in similar microclimates, a sampling interval of every 4 days minimizes data uncertainty and field work expenses. An analysis of the relationships among phenology, climate, and gross primary productivity (GPP) during the spring indicate that the phenology of the dominant tree species is responsible for an overall positive trend in carbon assimilation, but climate is the cause of day-to-day variation.},

Unfortunately, at the present time dwindling support and advocacy for collections-based reissued search has placed these institutions in the midst of a collections crisis. In this review, I assess the historical importance of living plant collections in supporting research, examine why their research potential is currently unmet, and provide a series of rationales in support of collections-based research. To avert this crisis several things must occur, the most basic of which is stronger advocacy for living collections and the research derived from them. Traditional views of collections management need to be evaluated under new light and the pool of researchers expanded. Formal, on-site programs are not required for collections to be used for research, as off-site scientists can make great contributions. Toward this end, collaborative links between the garden and research communities ought to be enhanced through the pivotal role played by curators and collections managers. Investment in data-management systems are also required to increase collection value and improve the ability to disseminate information to researchers who require it. If provided the necessary leadership and support, living plant collections have great potential to meet future scientific needs.},

@article{Ettinger2018,
	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Plant phenology is a critical trait, as the timings of phenophases such as budburst, leafout, flowering, and fruiting, are important to plant fitness. Despite much study about when individual phenophases occur and how they may shift with climate change, little is known about how multiple phenophases relate to one another across an entire growing season. We test the extent to which early phenological stages constrain later ones, throughout a growing season, across 25 angiosperm tree species. METHODS: We observed phenology (budburst, leafout, flowering, fruiting, and senescence) of 118 individual trees across 25 species, from April through December 2015. KEY RESULTS: We found that early phenological events weakly constrain most later events, with the strongest constraints seen between consecutive stages. In contrast, interphase duration was a much stronger predictor of phenology, especially for reproductive events, suggesting that the development time of flowers and fruits may constrain the phenology of these events. CONCLUSIONS: Much of the variation in later phenological events can be explained by the timing of earlier events and by interphase durations. This highlights that a shift in one phenophase may often have cascading effects on later phases. Accurate forecasts of climate change impacts should therefore include multiple phenophases within and across years.},

These resources include controlled growing conditions, living collections with broad taxonomic representation, meticulous record-keeping, networks spanning wide geographic areas, and knowledgeable staff. Indeed, botanical gardens have already contributed significantly to our understanding of biological responses to climate change, particularly the effects of temperature on the timing of flowering and leaf-out. They have also made significant contributions to the understanding of the relationships among climate, physiology, and anatomy. Gardens are finding new uses for traditional research tools such as herbarium specimens and historical photographs, which are increasingly being used to obtain information on past plant behavior. Additional work on invasive species and comparative studies of responses to climatic variation are providing insights on important ecological, evolutionary, and management questions. With their large collections of plant species from throughout the world and excellent herbaria, botanical gardens are well positioned to expand their current activities to continue to provide leadership in climate change research and education.},

	abstract = {Abstract Arctic warming is resulting in reduced snow cover and increased shrub growth, both of which have been associated with altered land surface--atmospheric feedback processes involving sensible heat flux, ground heat flux and biogeochemical cycling. Using field measurements, we show that two common Arctic shrub species (Betula glandulosa and Salix pulchra), which are largely responsible for shrub encroachment in tundra, differed markedly in albedo and that albedo of both species increased as growing season progressed when measured at their altitudinal limit. A moveable apparatus was used to repeatedly measure albedo at six precise spots during the summer of 2012, and resampled in 2013. Contrary to the generally accepted view of shrub-covered areas having low albedo in tundra, full-canopy prostrate B. glandulosa had almost the highest albedo of all surfaces measured during the peak of the growing season. The higher midsummer albedo is also evident in localized MODIS albedo aggregated from 2000 to 2013, which displays a similar increase in growing-season albedo. Using our field measurements, we show the ensemble summer increase in tundra albedo counteracts the generalized effect of earlier spring snow melt on surface energy balance by approximately 40\%. This summer increase in albedo, when viewed in absolute values, is as large as the difference between the forest and tundra transition. These results indicate that near future (<50 years) changes in growing-season albedo related to Arctic vegetation change are unlikely to be particularly large and might constitute a negative feedback to climate warming in certain circumstances. Future efforts to calculate energy budgets and a sensible heating feedback in the Arctic will require more detailed information about the relative abundance of different ground cover types, particularly shrub species and their respective growth forms and phenology.},

@article{Taylor2019,
	abstract = {Abstract Large-scale observational data from citizen science efforts are becoming increasingly common in ecology, and researchers often choose between these and data from intensive local-scale studies for their analyses. This choice has potential trade-offs related to spatial scale, observer variance, and interannual variability. Here we explored this issue with phenology by comparing models built using data from the large-scale, citizen science USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) effort with models built using data from more intensive studies at Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. We built statistical and process based phenology models for species common to each data set. From these models, we compared parameter estimates, estimates of phenological events, and out-of-sample errors between models derived from both USA-NPN and LTER data. We found that model parameter estimates for the same species were most similar between the two data sets when using simple models, but parameter estimates varied widely as model complexity increased. Despite this, estimates for the date of phenological events and out-of-sample errors were similar, regardless of the model chosen. Predictions for USA-NPN data had the lowest error when using models built from the USA-NPN data, while LTER predictions were best made using LTER-derived models, confirming that models perform best when applied at the same scale they were built. This difference in the cross-scale model comparison is likely due to variation in phenological requirements within species. Models using the USA-NPN data set can integrate parameters over a large spatial scale while those using an LTER data set can only estimate parameters for a single location. Accordingly, the choice of data set depends on the research question. Inferences about species-specific phenological requirements are best made with LTER data, and if USA-NPN or similar data are all that is available, then analyses should be limited to simple models. Large-scale predictive modeling is best done with the larger-scale USA-NPN data, which has high spatial representation and a large regional species pool. LTER data sets, on the other hand, have high site fidelity and thus characterize inter-annual variability extremely well. Future research aimed at forecasting phenology events for particular species over larger scales should develop models that integrate the strengths of both data sets.},

	abstract = {Global warming is affecting natural systems across the world. Of the biological responses to warming, changes in the timing of phenological events such as flowering are among the most sensitive. Despite the recognized importance of phenological changes, the limited number of long-term records of phenological events has restricted research on the topic in most areas of the world. In a previous study in Boston (American Journal of Botany 91: 1260-1264), we used herbarium specimens and one season of field observations to show that plants flowered earlier as the climate warmed over the past 100 yr. In our new study, we found that two extra years of data did not strengthen the explanatory power of the analysis. Analysis of herbarium specimens without any field data yielded results similar to analyses that included field observations. In addition, we found that photographs of cultivated and wild plants in Massachusetts, data similar to that contained in herbarium specimens, show changes in flowering times that closely match independent data on the same species in the same locations. Dated photographs of plants in flower represent a new resource to extend the range of species and localities addressed in global-warming research.},

	abstract = {Warming temperatures are advancing the timing of seasonal vegetation development in the extratropics, altering plant--animal interactions and increasing the risk of trophic asynchrony. Forest understories are critical yet under-observed ecosystems in which phenological patterns are both altered and obscured by overstory trees. We address the challenge of observing phenological dynamics in the understory by exploiting the physiological relationship between plant phenology and temperature accumulation, a horticultural principle we show to be preserved across spatial scales through a combination of field and growth-chamber observations. These observations provide the foundation for a spaceborne thermal-observation framework, which can trace the discrete phenophases of forest understory plants in near-real time. The thermal basis of this framework also enables the prediction of understory phenology for future climates, which we demonstrate here using Shepherdia canadensis, a widespread fruiting shrub of western North America that has important trophic connections to frugivores. Our approach enables researchers to assess the regional-scale impacts of climate change on bottom-up forest ecosystems and to monitor emerging trophic mismatches.},

	abstract = {Because climate change alters patterns of vegetative growth, long-term phenological measurements and observations can provide important data for analyzing its impact. Phenological assessments are usually made as records of calendar dates when specific phase changes occur. Such assessments have benefits and are used in Citizen Science monitoring. However, these kinds of data often have low statistical precision when describing gradual changes. Frequent monitoring of the phenological traits of forest trees and berries as they undergo gradual change is needed to acquire good temporal resolution of transitions relative to other factors, such as susceptibility to frosts, insects, and fungi, and the use of berries as a food resource. Intensive weekly monitoring of the growth of apical and branch buds and the elongation of shoots and leaves on four tree species, and the abundance of flowers and berries of bilberry and lingonberry, has been performed in Sweden since 2006. Here, we present quantitative methods for interpolating such data, which detail the gradual changes between assessments in order to describe average rates of development and amount of interannual variation. Our analysis has shown the active growth period of trees to differ with latitude. We also observed a change in the timing of the maximum numbers of ripening berries and their successive decline. Data from tree phenology assessments can be used to recommend best forestry practice and to model tree growth, while berry data can be used to estimate when food resources for animals are most available.},

@article{Hunter1992,
	abstract = {{$[$}1. Four models for predicting budburst in northern hardwood trees, based on response to spring warming alone, or with the response to spring warming modified by winter chilling and photoperiod, were compared. An historical, 18-year budburst record, and artificial datasets with budburst dates generated according to each of four conceptual models, were used to analyse the abilities of the models to predict budburst dates. 2. The four models all gave better predictions than could be obtained by taking the average date of budburst of a species. The historical budburst dates were most accurately predicted by models based only on spring warming from a fixed start date, or from a start date determined by the satisfaction of a chilling requirement. A photothermal model was only useful for species with late budburst dates, and gave relatively little improvement over the average date of budburst as a predictor. 3. Analysis of artificial datasets, in which budburst dates were generated according to the biological assumptions of each conceptual model, reveals little connection between the ability to predict budburst with accuracy and the underlying biological response to temperature. This should be a general caveat to modellers; even biologically incorrect models can give reasonably good predictions of budburst phenology.{$]$}},

@article{Fahey2016,
	abstract = {Abstract Timing of leaf out in woody plants is being affected by global climate change, with cascading effects on associated organisms and ecosystem processes. However, the timing and responsiveness of this important phenological event are not well understood, especially in relation to the geographic origin of species and populations. This study assessed the effect of anomalous spring warming on leaf out timing for woody plant species and individuals from a range of taxa and geographic origins. Timing of leaf out was assessed across 4 years (2011--2014) for 478 plants, representing 96 species and 21 genera, planted together in a common environment at The Morton Arboretum, Lisle, Illinois, USA. An anomalously warm spring in 2012 strongly affected leaf out timing, advancing mean leaf out date for every species by an average of 31 days across all individuals. Responsiveness was related to species traits, as species classified as early-successional, with diffuse-porous wood anatomy, or with a weak chilling requirement were much more responsive. There was strong variation among individuals within a species in leaf out timing and responsiveness. These patterns were somewhat related to geographical origin of the individual, but were not consistent among species or genera. High responsiveness of leaf out to anomalous spring warming, which is forecasted to be more common with global climate change, could have important implications for climate change adaptation, assisted migration, and ecological interactions. Chilling requirements may have limited responsiveness for some species, which could affect competitive dynamics within plant communities. Through such interactions and direct effects on woody plant species, variation in spring leaf out phenology will likely affect biodiversity and functioning in many ecosystems.},

@article{Elmendorf2019,
	abstract = {The sensitivity of phenology to environmental drivers can vary across geography and species. As such, models developed to predict phenology are typically site- or taxon-specific. Generation of site- and taxon-specific models is limited by the intensive in-situ phenological monitoring effort required to generate sufficient data to parameterize each model. Where in-situ phenological observations exist, the data are often subject to analytical issues due to the limited duration of any individual monitoring program, spotty site- and species- level coverage, lack of standardized methodology, and infrequent or variable census intervals. Together, these characteristics constrain our ability to make phenological inferences outside of select sites and taxa where long-duration, intensive monitoring has occurred. In this study, we leveraged two national, standardized phenology datasets to develop a multi-species and multi-site state-space survival model of the onset of deciduous tree and shrub spring (leaf out) and fall (leaf-color) events across temperate ecoregions of the United States. We used data from two national-scale phenological databases, a 9-year, broadly distributed dataset from the USA National Phenology Network and a 4-year dataset from the National Ecological Observatory Network, to quantify regional and interspecific variation in sensitivity to environmental drivers for both spring and fall leaf phenophases. Spring leaf out was generally promoted by longer days, spring growing degree day accumulation, overwinter chilling, and was suppressed by frost events, whereas fall leaf color was promoted by shorter days and cold accumulation. The sensitivity to most environmental drivers tended to be more variable among species than among the regions as defined here (EPA ecoregions of North America, excluding desert and tropical areas). The results of this study lay the groundwork for incorporating the growing collection of phenological observations into a generalized framework for predicting the transition states for any species, in any location.},

	abstract = {Abstract Spring heat accumulation plays a major role in the timing of events such as leaf-out, leaf expansion, flowering, and insect hatch in temperate systems. Accordingly, heat accumulation can serve as a proxy for the timing of plant and insect phenological activity and can be used in a predictive way when the timing of heat accumulation thresholds being reached can be anticipated. This has strong value for a host of planning and management applications. If relationships exist between earlier- and later-season thresholds at a location, then the timing of later-season phenological events that are forced by the accumulation of warmth could be anticipated based on when earlier-season thresholds are met. Using high-resolution daily temperature data, we calculated the coherence in pairs of spring-season heat accumulation (growing degree day) threshold anomalies over 1948--2016. Overall, relationships between thresholds spanning the entire spring season were relatively low, while later season thresholds exhibited much higher correlations. This pattern is generally the result of decreasing variability in heat accumulation with season progression. However, correlation strengths did not follow latitudinal or gradients, revealing that within-season heat accumulation and interannual variability in threshold timing are unique to the specified base temperature and thresholds being compared. We show that the relationships between earlier- and later-season heat accumulation thresholds were sufficient to accurately predict the timing of phenological events in plants in two case examples.},

	abstract = {The onset of spring plant growth has shifted earlier in the year over the past several decades due to rising global temperatures. Earlier spring onset may cause phenological mismatches between the availability of plant resources and dependent animals, and potentially lead to more false springs, when subsequent freezing temperatures damage new plant growth. We used the extended spring indices to project changes in spring onset, defined by leaf out and by first bloom, and predicted false springs until 2100 in the conterminous United States (US) using statistically-downscaled climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 ensemble. Averaged over our study region, the median shift in spring onset was 23 days earlier in the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario with particularly large shifts in the Western US and the Great Plains. Spatial variation in phenology was due to the influence of short-term temperature changes around the time of spring onset versus season-long accumulation of warm temperatures. False spring risk increased in the Great Plains and portions of the Midwest, but remained constant or decreased elsewhere. We conclude that global climate change may have complex and spatially variable effects on spring onset and false springs, making local predictions of change difficult.},

	abstract = {Forest mortality constitutes a major uncertainty in projections of climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and carbon-cycle feedbacks. Recent drought-induced, widespread forest die-offs highlight that climate change could accelerate forest mortality with its diverse and potentially severe consequences for the global carbon cycle, ecosystem services, and biodiversity. How trees die during drought over multiple years remains largely unknown and precludes mechanistic modeling and prediction of forest die-off with climate change. Here, we examine the physiological basis of a recent multiyear widespread die-off of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) across much of western North America. Using observations from both native trees while they are dying and a rainfall exclusion experiment on mature trees, we measure hydraulic performance over multiple seasons and years and assess pathways of accumulated hydraulic damage. We test whether accumulated hydraulic damage can predict the probability of tree survival over 2 years. We find that hydraulic damage persisted and increased in dying trees over multiple years and exhibited few signs of repair. This accumulated hydraulic deterioration is largely mediated by increased vulnerability to cavitation, a process known as cavitation fatigue. Furthermore, this hydraulic damage predicts the probability of interyear stem mortality. Contrary to the expectation that surviving trees have weathered severe drought, the hydraulic deterioration demonstrated here reveals that surviving regions of these forests are actually more vulnerable to future droughts due to accumulated xylem damage. As the most widespread tree species in North America, increasing vulnerability to drought in these forests has important ramifications for ecosystem stability, biodiversity, and ecosystem carbon balance. Our results provide a foundation for incorporating accumulated drought impacts into climate-vegetation models. Finally, our findings highlight the critical role of drought stress accumulation and repair of stress-induced damage for avoiding plant mortality, presenting a dynamic and contingent framework for drought impacts on forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {P{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}1. Climate change is predicted to bring earlier bud break and perhaps a greater risk of frost damage to developing leaves and flowers. Given the rarity and unpredictability of major frost events and limited community-level phenological observations, comparisons among deciduous forest species experiencing frost damage and refoliation are rare. 2. This study used phenological observations ongoing at the time of a hard freeze to compare leaf and flower development, frost damage and leaf refoliation of 20 deciduous woody species in Trelease Woods, Champaign Co., IL, USA. Freezing temperatures from 5 to 9 April 2007 followed 22 days after very warm temperatures began in March. 3. Bud break was the earliest in 17 years. Frost caused damage to leaf buds, developing shoots and/or expanding leaves of canopy trees of six species and saplings of two species. Undamaged species were inactive, or in bud break or shoot expansion. Among damaged species, 11-100{\{}{\%}{\}} of individuals exhibited some frost damage. Mean damage level per individual ranged from 20{\{}{\%}{\}} to 100{\{}{\%}{\}} among species. 4. Refoliation from dormant buds led to mean final canopy fullness that ranged from 46{\{}{\%}{\}} to 99{\{}{\%}{\}} among damaged species, but time of full leaf expansion was extended by 16-34 days for refoliating species. 5. Frost damaged flowers, but not flower buds or developing fruit, of five of eight species that flowered during the frost period. 6. The extent of frost damage in 2007 was unusual; damage was greater than any of the other 4 years with frost damage from 1993 to 2009 because record-breaking March temperatures in 2007 caused more species to be at later vulnerable stages with the advent of subfreezing temperatures in April. 7. Differences among individuals and species in frost damage and ability to refoliate caused strong selection on individuals and differences in carbon gain that could, in the long-term, affect species' abundances. The frost also reduced fruit/seed abundance for insects and mammals.},

	abstract = {Climate change, with both warmer spring temperatures and greater temperature fluctuations, has altered phenologies, possibly leading to greater risk of spring frost damage to temperate deciduous woody plants. Phenological observations of 20 woody species from 1993 to 2012 in Trelease Woods, Champaign County, Illinois, USA, were used to identify years with frost damage to vegetative and reproductive phases. Local temperature records were used in combination with the phenological observations to determine what combinations of the two were associated with damage. Finally, a long-term temperature record (1889-1992) was evaluated to determine if the frequency of frost damage has risen in recent decades. Frost {\{}{\textless}{\}} or = -1.7 degrees C occurred after bud-break in 14 of the 20 years of observation. Frost damage occurred in five years in the interior and in three additional years at only the forest edge. The degree of damage varied with species, life stage, tissue (vegetative or reproductive), and phenological phase. Common features associated with the occurrence of damage to interior plants were (1) a period of unusual warm temperatures in March, followed by (2) a frost event in April with a minimum temperature {\{}{\textless}{\}} or = -6.1 degrees C with (3) a period of 16-33 days between the extremes. In the long-term record, 10 of 124 years met these conditions, but the yearly probability of frost damage increased significantly, from 0.03 during 1889-1979 to 0.21 during 1980-2012. When the criteria were "softened" to {\{}{\textless}{\}} or = -1.7 degrees C in April and an interval of 16-37 days, 31 of 124 years met the conditions, and the yearly damage probability increased significantly to 0.19 for 1889-1979 and 0.42 for 1980-2012. In this forest, the combination of warming trends and temperature variability (extremes) associated with climate change is having ecologically important effects, making previously rare frost damage events more common.},

For example, March 2012 broke numerous records for warm temperatures and early flowering in the United States [Karl et al., 2012; Elwood et al., 2013]. Many regions experienced a ``false spring,'' a period of weather in late winter or early spring sufficiently mild and long to bring vegetation out of dormancy prematurely, rendering it vulnerable to late frost and drought.},

	abstract = {Climate change is expected to modify the timing of seasonal transitions this century, impacting wildlife migrations, ecosystem function, and agricultural activity. Tracking seasonal transitions in a consistent manner across space and through time requires indices that can be used for monitoring and managing biophysical and ecological systems during the coming decades. Here a new gridded dataset of spring indices is described and used to understand interannual, decadal, and secular trends across the coterminous United States. This dataset is derived from daily interpolated meteorological data, and the results are compared with historical station data to ensure the trends and variations are robust. Regional trends in the first leaf index range from 20.8 to 21.6 days decade 21 , while first bloom index trends are between 20.4 and 21.2 for most regions. However, these trends are modulated by interannual to multidecadal variations, which are substantial throughout the regions considered here. These findings emphasize the important role large-scale climate modes of variability play in modulating spring onset on interannual to multidecadal time scales. Finally, there is some potential for successful subseasonal forecasts of spring onset, as indices from most regions are sig-nificantly correlated with antecedent large-scale modes of variability.},

@article{Basler2012,
	abstract = {The timing of spring phenology of trees reflects a trade-off between a longer growing season and a lower risk for damage by late freezing events. Temperature is driving rates of development directly, but given the high inter-annual variability in weather, it is a poor environmental cue for the progression of the season and thus, the period with low freezing risk. In contrast, photoperiod is a reliable and weather independent signal of the progression of the season. Using growth chamber experiments we assessed the photoperiod sensitivity of bud burst under artificial spring conditions in cuttings of 14 common European tree species that belong to different life-strategy types (pioneers or exotic species vs. native late-successional species; 3 conifers/11 broadleaved). Fully chilled twigs were sampled from populations along two elevational gradients in the Swiss Alps. Applying realistic contrasts in photoperiod, short photoperiods delayed bud burst in five late successional species to variable degree, whereas no distinct photoperiod sensitivity was observed in early successional species. In Picea abies, the photoperiod response was additionally influenced by elevation of origin, whereas in Quercus petraea and Abies alba regional differences in the photoperiod response were observed. For late successional species, photoperiod is thus an important environmental signal that will constrain responses to climatic warming because rising temperatures will drive phenology toward the species specific photoperiod threshold. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Basler2016,
	abstract = {Inter-annual variation in climate is reflected by changes in the timing of phenology. Over the last decades a considerable number of models have been developed in order to explain the inter-annual variation of spring phenology in trees. Contrary to empirical models, ``process-based'' models aim at simulating physiological processes in order to yield more realistic predictions of growing season onset dates. Despite the increasing knowledge on the environmental controls of seasonal dormancy in trees, the detailed action and interaction of the involved environmental drivers (chilling, photoperiod and warm temperature) remains to be elucidated. This study aims at a uniform comparison of a wide range of existing models (and new recombinations), on a multitude of long-term observation series in six tree species across central Europe, using extensive cross-validation. Even though the assessed models differ in the phases of dormancy and environmental drivers accounted for, they yielded a surprisingly similar quality of prediction of leaf unfolding dates. Depending on the species, the lowest average prediction errors for leaf unfolding (RMSE) ranged from 7 to 9 days for the dataset pooled across sites and years and from 4 to 6 days for site-specific predictions, in absence of any obvious geographical pattern. Simple models, that feature ecodormancy release only, performed similar or better than more complex models, which additionally include endodormancy release through chilling temperatures. Model parameterisation tended to converge towards similar behaviour and models with many parameters tended to overfit on the 40 year time-series of leaf unfolding. Additionally, all models tended to underestimate the inter-annual variation of leaf unfolding and failed to predict very early or late dates of leaf unfolding in certain years. The transfer of site-specific parameters to other sites was associated with an almost doubling of the average prediction error, independent of distance and climatic similarity between the calibration and validation sites. The findings challenge the accurate implementation of the physiological processes controlling spring phenology in the models and highlight shortcomings associated with model parameterisation on observational time-series only.},

	abstract = {Stable isotope analysis (SIA) has proven to be a useful tool in reconstructing diets, characterizing trophic relationships, elucidating patterns of resource allocation, and constructing food webs. Consequently, the number of studies using SIA in trophic ecology has increased exponentially over the past decade. Several subdisciplines have developed, including isotope mixing models, incorporation dynamics models, lipid-extraction and correction methods, isotopic routing models, and compound-specific isotopic analysis. As with all tools, there are limitations to SIA. Chief among these are multiple sources of variation in isotopic signatures, unequal taxonomic and ecosystem coverage, over-reliance on literature values for key parameters, lack of canonical models, untested or unrealistic assumptions, low predictive power, and a paucity of experimental studies. We anticipate progress in SIA resulting from standardization of methods and models, calibration of model parameters through experimentation, and continued development of several recent approaches such as isotopic routing models and compound-specific isotopic analysis.},

	abstract = {Volcanic eruptions have been hypothesized as an iron supply mechanism for phytoplankton blooms; however, little direct evidence of stimulatory responses has been obtained in the field. Here we present the results of twenty-one 1--2 day bottle enrichment experiments from cruises in the South Atlantic and Southern Ocean which conclusively demonstrated a photophysiological and biomass stimulation of phytoplankton communities following supply of basaltic or rhyolitic volcanic ash. Furthermore, experiments in the Southern Ocean demonstrated significant phytoplankton community responses to volcanic ash supply in the absence of responses to addition of dissolved iron alone. At these sites, dissolved manganese concentrations were among the lowest ever measured in seawater, and we therefore suggest that the enhanced response to ash may have been a result of the relief of manganese (co)limitation. Our results imply that volcanic ash deposition events could trigger extensive phytoplankton blooms, potentially capable of significant impacts on regional carbon cycling.},

@article{Caffarra2011,
	abstract = {The process of adaptation is the result of stabilising selection caused by two opposite forces: protection against an unfavourable season (survival adaptation), and effective use of growing resources (capacity adaptation). As plant species have evolved different life strategies based on different trade offs between survival and capacity adaptations, different phenological responses are also expected among species. The aim of this study was to compare budburst responses of two opportunistic species (Betula pubescens, and Salix x smithiana) with that of two long-lived, late successional species (Fagus sylvatica and Tilia cordata) and consider their ecological significance. Thus, we performed a series of experiments whereby temperature and photoperiod were manipulated during dormancy. T. cordata and F. sylvatica showed low rates of budburst, high chilling requirements and responsiveness to light intensity, while B. pubescens and S. x smithiana had high rates of budburst, low chilling requirements and were not affected by light intensity. In addition, budburst in B. pubescens and S. x smithiana was more responsive to high forcing temperatures than in T. cordata and F. sylvatica. These results suggest that the timing of growth onset in B. pubescens and S. x smithiana (opportunistic) is regulated through a less conservative mechanism than in T. cordata and F. sylvatica (long-lived, late successional), and that these species trade a higher risk of frost damage for the opportunity of vigorous growth at the beginning of spring, before canopy closure. This information should be considered when assessing the impacts of climate change on vegetation or developing phenological models.},

The annual temperature cycle, moisture relation, latitude, elevation, and distance from the ocean of the site of origin of a population also influenced the rate of bud burst in the population under controlled conditions.

	abstract = {1. Harsh abiotic conditions -- such as low temperatures that lead to spring and summer frost events in high-elevation and high-latitude ecosystems -- can have strong negative consequences for plant growth, survival and reproduction. 2. Despite the predicted increase in episodic frost events under continued climate change in some ecosystems, our general understanding of the factors associated with frost sensitivity of reproductive and vegetative plant structures in natural plant communities is limited. The timing of growth and reproduction may be an important strategy by which plants can avoid frost. 3. In this study, we experimentally investigated the frost sensitivity of eight long-lived perennial herbaceous plant species from a subalpine ecosystem in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, USA. The study taxa represent four congeneric pairs from four flowering plant families; within each pair, there is a species with early and late growth and reproductive phenology. Thus, we control for evolution- ary history -- and therefore additional traits shared through common ancestry -- to some degree, while examining the influence of phenology on frost sensitivity. Specifically, we compared frost sen- sitivity of vegetative and reproductive structures for each species and asked whether frost sensitivity was similar between species within congeneric pairs or, instead, was related to phenology (i.e. dif- ferences in the timing of growth and reproduction). 4. For most species (6 of 8), flowers were more sensitive to frost than leaves. Within most con- generic pairs (3 of 4), the leaves of species with later phenology were significantly more sensitive to frost than the leaves of species with earlier phenology. For flowers, the later flowering species were more sensitive in two of the four congeneric pairs. 5. Synthesis. This study contributes to our general understanding of factors related to interspecific differences in plant sensitivity to episodic frost events of naturally occurring species. The increased frost sensitivity of reproductive structures compared to vegetative structures may be a widespread pattern for long-lived perennial plants. Furthermore, we find evidence for a trade-off between phe- nology and frost sensitivity, whereby species with later phenology exhibit higher frost sensitivity compared to species with earlier phenology. These results have implications for plant populations, species interactions and ecological communities.},

	abstract = {Abstract Temperate plants are at risk of being exposed to late spring freezes. These freeze events---often called false springs---are one of the strongest factors determining temperate plants species range limits and can impose high ecological and economic damage. As climate change may alter the prevalence and severity of false springs, our ability to forecast such events has become more critical, and it has led to a growing body of research. Many false spring studies largely simplify the myriad complexities involved in assessing false spring risks and damage. While these studies have helped advance the field and may provide useful estimates at large scales, studies at the individual to community levels must integrate more complexity for accurate predictions of plant damage from late spring freezes. Here we review current metrics of false spring, and how, when and where plants are most at risk of freeze damage. We highlight how life stage, functional group, species differences in morphology and phenology, and regional climatic differences contribute to the damage potential of false springs. More studies aimed at understanding relationships among species tolerance and avoidance strategies, climatic regimes, and the environmental cues that underlie spring phenology would improve predictions at all biological levels. An integrated approach to assessing past and future spring freeze damage would provide novel insights into fundamental plant biology, and offer more robust predictions as climate change progresses, which is essential for mitigating the adverse ecological and economic effects of false springs.

@article{Charrier2011,
	abstract = {As observed for most stresses, tree frost resistance can be split into two main processes: avoidance and tolerance. Avoidance of freezing is achieved by introducing species only in the climatic context in which the probability of freezing events is very low for the sensitive stages of buds or stems; i.e., when good synchronism exists between the annual cycle and the critical climatic periods. Buds become able to grow only after chilling requirements have been satisfied (endodormancy released) during winter; they subsequently break after heat requirements have been completed (end of ecodormancy) in early spring. Actually, this period is often subject to more or less severe freezing events. Trees are also able to adjust their freezing tolerance by increasing their capacity of extracellular freezing and decreasing the possibility of intracellular freezing through the process of frost acclimation. Both freezing resistance processes (avoidance and tolerance) are environmentally driven (by photoperiod and temperature), but there are also genotypic effects among species or cultivars. Here, we evaluated the degree to which differences in dormancy release and frost acclimation were related to environmental and genetic influences by comparing trees growing in common garden conditions. This investigation was carried out for two winters in lowland and mountain locations on different walnut genotypes differing significantly for budburst dates. Chilling requirement for endodormancy release and heat requirement during ecodormancy were evaluated in all situations. In addition, frost acclimation was assessed by the electrolyte leakage method on stems from the same trees before leaf fall through budburst. No significant differences were observed in chilling requirements among genotypes. Moreover, frost acclimation dynamics were similar between genotypes or locations when expressed depending on chilling units accumulated since 15 September as a time basis instead of Julian day. The only exception was for maximal frost hardiness observed during winter with the timber-oriented being significantly more resistant than fruit-oriented genotypes. Heat requirement was significantly different among genotypes. Thus, growth was significantly faster in fruit-oriented than in wood-oriented genotypes. Furthermore, among wood-oriented genotypes, differences in growth rate were observed only at cold temperatures. Frost acclimation changes differed significantly between fruit- and wood- walnuts from January through budburst. In conclusion, from September through January, the acclimation dynamic was driven mainly by environmental factors whereas from January through budburst a significant genotype effect was identified in both frost tolerance and avoidance processes.},

Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the 'leaf economics spectrum', a similar 'wood economics spectrum' may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits.},

	abstract = {Global warming is expected to have a major impact on plant distributions, an issue of key importance in biological conservation. However, very few models are able to predict species distribution accurately, although we know species respond individually to climate change. Here we show, using a process-based model (PHENOFIT), that tree species distributions can be predicted precisely if the biological processes of survival and reproductive success only are incorporated as a function of phenology. These predictions showed great predictive power when tested against present distributions of two North American species???quaking aspen and sugar maple???indicating that on a broad scale, the fundamental niche of trees coincides with their realized niche. Phenology is shown here to be a major determinant of plant species range and should therefore be used to assess the consequences of global warming on plant distributions, and the spread of alien plant species.},

	abstract = {Plants are finely tuned to the seasonality of their environment, and shifts in the timing of plant activity (i.e. phenology) provide some of the most compelling evidence that species and ecosystems are being influenced by global environmental change. Researchers across disciplines have observed shifting phenology at multiple scales, including earlier spring flowering in individual plants and an earlier spring green-up' of the land surface revealed in satellite images. Experimental and modeling approaches have sought to identify the mechanisms causing these shifts, as well as to make predictions regarding the consequences. Here, we discuss recent advances in several fields that have enabled scaling between species responses to recent climatic changes and shifts in ecosystem productivity, with implications for global carbon cycling. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Estiarte2015,
	abstract = {Abstract Leaf senescence in winter deciduous species signals the transition from the active to the dormant stage. The purpose of leaf senescence is the recovery of nutrients before the leaves fall. Photoperiod and temperature are the main cues controlling leaf senescence in winter deciduous species, with water stress imposing an additional influence. Photoperiod exerts a strict control on leaf senescence at latitudes where winters are severe and temperature gains importance in the regulation as winters become less severe. On average, climatic warming will delay and drought will advance leaf senescence, but at varying degrees depending on the species. Warming and drought thus have opposite effects on the phenology of leaf senescence, and the impact of climate change will therefore depend on the relative importance of each factor in specific regions. Warming is not expected to have a strong impact on nutrient proficiency although a slower speed of leaf senescence induced by warming could facilitate a more efficient nutrient resorption. Nutrient resorption is less efficient when the leaves senesce prematurely as a consequence of water stress. The overall effects of climate change on nutrient resorption will depend on the contrasting effects of warming and drought. Changes in nutrient resorption and proficiency will impact production in the following year, at least in early spring, because the construction of new foliage relies almost exclusively on nutrients resorbed from foliage during the preceding leaf fall. Changes in the phenology of leaf senescence will thus impact carbon uptake, but also ecosystem nutrient cycling, especially if the changes are consequence of water stress.},

@article{Foley1998,
	abstract = {Abstract Numerous studies have underscored the importance of terrestrial ecosystems as an integral component of the Earth's climate system. This realization has already led to efforts to link simple equilibrium vegetation models with Atmospheric General Circulation Models through iterative coupling procedures. While these linked models have pointed to several possible climate?vegetation feedback mechanisms, they have been limited by two shortcomings: (i) they only consider the equilibrium response of vegetation to shifting climatic conditions and therefore cannot be used to explore transient interactions between climate and vegetation; and (ii) the representations of vegetation processes and land-atmosphere exchange processes are still treated by two separate models and, as a result, may contain physical or ecological inconsistencies. Here we present, as a proof concept, a more tightly integrated framework for simulating global climate and vegetation interactions. The prototype coupled model consists of the GENESIS (version 2) Atmospheric General Circulation Model and the IBIS (version 1) Dynamic Global Vegetation Model. The two models are directly coupled through a common treatment of land surface and ecophysiological processes, which is used to calculate the energy, water, carbon, and momentum fluxes between vegetation, soils, and the atmosphere. On one side of the interface, GENESIS simulates the physics and general circulation of the atmosphere. On the other side, IBIS predicts transient changes in the vegetation structure through changes in the carbon balance and competition among plants within terrestrial ecosystems. As an initial test of this modelling framework, we perform a 30?year simulation in which the coupled model is supplied with modern CO2 concentrations, observed ocean temperatures, and modern insolation. In this exploratory study, we run the GENESIS atmospheric model at relatively coarse horizontal resolution (4.5$\,^{\circ}$latitude by 7.5$\,^{\circ}$longitude) and IBIS at moderate resolution (2$\,^{\circ}$latitude by 2$\,^{\circ}$longitude). We initialize the models with globally uniform climatic conditions and the modern distribution of potential vegetation cover. While the simulation does not fully reach equilibrium by the end of the run, several general features of the coupled model behaviour emerge. We compare the results of the coupled model against the observed patterns of modern climate. The model correctly simulates the basic zonal distribution of temperature and precipitation, but several important regional biases remain. In particular, there is a significant warm bias in the high northern latitudes, and cooler than observed conditions over the Himalayas, central South America, and north-central Africa. In terms of precipitation, the model simulates drier than observed conditions in much of South America, equatorial Africa and Indonesia, with wetter than observed conditions in northern Africa and China. Comparing the model results against observed patterns of vegetation cover shows that the general placement of forests and grasslands is roughly captured by the model. In addition, the model simulates a roughly correct separation of evergreen and deciduous forests in the tropical, temperate and boreal zones. However, the general patterns of global vegetation cover are only approximately correct: there are still significant regional biases in the simulation. In particular, forest cover is not simulated correctly in large portions of central Canada and southern South America, and grasslands extend too far into northern Africa. These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of coupling climate models with fully dynamic representations of the terrestrial biosphere. Continued development of fully coupled climate-vegetation models will facilitate the exploration of a broad range of global change issues, including the potential role of vegetation feedbacks within the climate system, and the impact of climate variability and transient climate change on the terrestrial biosphere.},

	abstract = {Air temperatures play a major role on temperate fruit development, and the projected future warming may thereby bring additional threats. The present study aims at analyzing the impacts of climate change on chilling and heat forcing on European vineyards and olive (V\&O) orchards. Chilling portions (CP) and growing degree hours (GDH) were computed yearly for the recent past (1989--2005) and the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 future scenarios (2021--2080), using several regional-global climate models, also considering model uncertainties and biases. Additionally, minimum CP and GDH values found in 90{\%} of all years were also computed. These metrics were then extracted to the current location of V\&O in Europe, and CP-GDH delimitations were assessed. For recent past, high CP values are found in north-central European regions, while lower values tend to exist on opposite sides of Europe. Regarding forcing, southern European regions currently show the highest GDH values. Future projections point to an increased warming, particularly under RCP8.5 and for 2041 onwards. A lower/higher CP is projected for south-western/eastern Europe, while most of Europe is projected to have higher GDH. Northern-central European V\&O orchards should still have future CP-GDH similar to present values, while most of southern European orchards are expected to have much lower CP and higher GDH, especially under RCP8.5. These changes may bring limitations to some of the world most important V\&O producers, such as Spain, Italy and Portugal. The planning of suitable adaptation measures against these threats is critical for the future sustainability of the European V\&O sectors.},

	abstract = {Understanding how changing climate, nutrient regimes, and invasive species shift food web structure is critically important in ecology. Most analytical approaches, however, assume static species interactions and environmental effects across time. Therefore, we applied multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models in a moving window context to test for shifting plankton community interactions and effects of environmental variables on plankton abundance in Lake Washington, U.S.A. from 1962-1994, following reduced nutrient loading in the 1960s and the rise of Daphnia in the 1970s. The moving-window MAR (mwMAR) approach showed shifts in the strengths of interactions between Daphnia, a dominant grazer, and other plankton taxa between a high nutrient, Oscillatoria-dominated regime and a low nutrient, Daphnia-dominated regime. The approach also highlighted the inhibiting influence of the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria on other plankton taxa in the community. Overall community stability was lowest during the period of elevated nutrient loading and Oscillatoria dominance. Despite recent warming of the lake, we found no evidence that anomalous temperatures impacted plankton abundance. Our results suggest mwMAR modeling is a useful approach that can be applied across diverse ecosystems, when questions involve shifting relationships within food webs, and among species and abiotic drivers.},

	abstract = {Phenology models are tools to analyze changes in the timing and duration of the growing season. During the past three decades different budburst models have been developed, but, so far, no consensus model has been found to accurately predict budburst date across different tree species. The aim of this study was to estimate the performance of six different temperature-driven models of leaf budburst (thermal time, thermal period fixed, sequential, parallel, alternating, unified) for four temperate tree species in Belgium (birch, chestnut, oak, beech). The models were parameterized using a Bayesian approach. The performance of these models was compared using Bayesian model comparison (BMC) and root mean square error (RMSE).Model comparison showed that the two models that do not include a calculation of chilling requirement were the best for the studied four tree species. The Sequential model (SM) was the third most plausible model for predicting budburst, having a higher probability to be correct than the other two-phase models combining a chilling phase with a forcing phase. This suggested that in our budburst observation dataset, the chilling requirement was probably always fulfilled, making the date of budburst controlled by forcing temperature. We cannot rule out that in warmer regions or future warmer conditions, chilling may become insufficient and a sequential pattern of chilling and forcing may become most appropriate to simulate budburst date. Parameter analysis showed that the last month prior to budburst had the greatest impact on determining the date of bud opening in the case of birch and chestnut, whereas the last 3 months were the main determinants for oak and beech, the two later flushing species. Validation showed that the models that fitted the parameterization data well had much poorer performance when tested with independent data. This indicates that other factors (e.g. photoperiod) might affect the budburst process and/or model parameterization (determining the sensitivity of budburst to temperature) substantially change between different localities. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Peatlands are important sinks of atmospheric carbon (C) that, in response to climate warming, are undergoing dynamic vegetation succession. Here we examined the hypothesis that the uptake of nutrients by different plant growth forms (PGFs) is one key mechanism driving changes in species abundance in peatlands. Along an altitude gradient representing a natural climate experiment, we compared the variability of the stable C isotope composition ({\$}\delta{\$}(13)C) and stable nitrogen (N) isotope composition ({\$}\delta{\$}(15)N) in current-year leaves of two major PGFs, i.e. ericoids and graminoids. The climate gradient was associated with a gradient of vascular plant cover, which was parallelled by different concentrations of organic and inorganic N as well as the fungal/bacterial ratio in peat. In both PGFs the (13)C natural abundance showed a marginal spatial decrease with altitude and a temporal decrease with progression of the growing season. Our data highlight a primary physical control of foliar {\$}\delta{\$}(13)C signature, which is independent from the PGFs. Natural abundance of foliar (15)N did not show any seasonal pattern and only in the ericoids showed depletion at lower elevation. This decreasing {\$}\delta{\$}(15)N pattern was primarily controlled by the higher relative availability of organic versus inorganic N and, only for the ericoids, by an increased proportion of fungi to bacteria in soil. Our space-for-time approach demonstrates that a change in abundance of PGFs is associated with a different strategy of nutrient acquisition (i.e. transfer via mycorrhizal symbiosis versus direct fine-root uptake), which could likely promote observed and predicted dwarf shrub expansion under climate change.},

	abstract = {Abstract Plant ecologists have long been concerned with a seemingly paradoxical scenario in the relationship between plant growth and climate change: warming may actually increase the risk of plant frost damage. The underlying hypothesis is that mild winters and warm, early springs, which are expected to occur as the climate warms, may induce premature plant development, resulting in exposure of vulnerable plant tissues and organs to subsequent late-season frosts. The 2007 spring freeze in the eastern United States provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate this hypothesis and assess its large-scale consequences. In this article, we contrast the rapid prefreeze phenological advancement caused by unusually warm conditions with the dramatic postfreeze setback, and report complicated patterns of freeze damage to plants. The widespread devastation of crops and natural vegetation occasioned by this event demonstrates the need to consider large fluctuations in spring temperatures a real threat to terrestrial ecosystem structure and functioning in a warming climate.},

@article{Gurung2012,
	abstract = {The conference on Global Change and the World's Mountains held in Perth, Scotland, in 2010 offered a unique opportunity to analyze the state and progress of mountain research and its contribution to sustainable mountain development, as well as to reflect on required reorientations of research agendas. In this paper we provide the results of a three-step assessment of the research presented by 450 researchers from around the world. First, we determined the state of the art of mountain research and categorized it based on the analytical structure of the Global Land Project (GLP 2005). Second, we identified emerging themes for future research. Finally, we assessed the contribution of mountain research to sustainable development along the lines of the Grand Challenges in Global Sustainability Research (International Council for Science 2010). Analysis revealed that despite the growing recognition of the importance of more integrative research (inter- and transdisciplinary), the research community gathered in Perth still focuses on environmental drivers of change and on interactions within ecological systems. Only a small percentage of current research seeks to enhance understanding of social systems and of interactions between social and ecological systems. From the ecological systems perspective, a greater effort is needed to disentangle and assess different drivers of change and to investigate impacts on the rendering of ecosystem services. From the social systems perspective, significant shortcomings remain in understanding the characteristics, trends, and impacts of human movements to, within, and out of mountain areas as a form of global change. Likewise, sociocultural drivers affecting collective behavior as well as incentive systems devised by policy and decision makers are little understood and require more in-depth investigation. Both the complexity of coupled social--ecological systems and incomplete data sets hinder integrated systems research. Increased understanding of linkages and feedbacks between social and ecological systems will help to identify nonlinearities and thresholds (tipping points) in both system types. This presupposes effective collaboration between ecological and social sciences. Reflections on the Grand Challenges in Sustainability Research put forth by the International Council for Science (2010) reveal the need to intensify research on effective responses and innovations. This will help to achieve sustainable development in mountain regions while maintaining the core competence of mountain research in forecasting and observation.},

	abstract = {Climate warming has increased researchers' interest in plant phenology and its modelling. Although the main focus is on projections of accelerated springtime phenological events, also a further extension of the growing season by delayed growth cessation is often projected. However, ecophysiological studies indicate that, for boreal and temperate trees, such generalisations are precluded owing to differential climatic conditions and inter- and intraspecific genetic differences. The annual cycle of these trees is an integrated system, where one phase affects subsequent phases, resulting in delayed impacts, which are only partially addressed in current ecophysiological models. Here, we outline an updated integrated conceptual model of the annual cycle by identifying ecophysiological phenomena that are particularly significant under climate warming.},

	abstract = {The effect of temperature during short-day (SD) dormancy induction was examined in three boreal tree species in a controlled environment. Saplings of Betula pendula Roth, B. pubescens Ehrh. and Alnus glutinosa (L.) Moench. were exposed to 5 weeks of 10-h SD induction at 9, 15 and 21 {\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}}C followed by chilling at 5 {\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}}C for 40, 70, 100 and 130 days and subsequent forcing at 15 {\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}}C in a 24-h photoperiod for 60 days. In all species and with all chilling periods, high temperature during SD dormancy induction significantly delayed bud burst during subsequent flushing at 15 {\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}}C. In A. glutinosa, high temperature during SD dormancy induction also significantly increased the chilling requirement for dormancy release. Field experiments at 60{\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}} N with a range of latitudinal birch populations revealed a highly significant correlation between autumn temperature and days to bud burst in the subsequent spring. September temperature alone explained 20{\{}{\%}{\}} of the variation between years in time of bud burst. In birch populations from 69 and 71{\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}} N, which ceased growing and shed their leaves in August when the mean temperature was 15 {\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}}C, bud burst occurred later than expected compared with lower latitude populations (56{\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}} N) in which dormancy induction took place more than 2 months later at a mean temperature of about 6 {\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}}C. It is concluded that this autumn temperature response may be important for counterbalancing the potentially adverse effects of higher winter temperatures on dormancy stability of boreal trees during climate warming.},

@article{Hufkens2012,
	abstract = {In the spring of 2010, temperatures averaged similar to 3 similar to degrees C above the long-term mean (MarchMay) across the northeastern United States. However, in mid-to-late spring, much of this region experienced a severe frost event. The spring of 2010 therefore provides a case study on how future spring temperature extremes may affect northeastern forest ecosystems. We assessed the response of three northern hardwood tree species (sugar maple, American beech, yellow birch) to these anomalous temperature patterns using several different data sources and addressed four main questions: (1) Along an elevational gradient, how was each species affected by the late spring frost? (2) How did differences in phenological growth strategy influence their response? (3) How did the late spring frost affect ecosystem productivity within the study domain? (4) What are the potential long-term impacts of spring frost events on forest community ecology? Our results show that all species exhibited early leaf development triggered by the warm spring. However, yellow birch and American beech have more conservative growth strategies and were largely unaffected by the late spring frost. In contrast, sugar maples responded strongly to warmer temperatures and experienced widespread frost damage that resulted in leaf loss and delayed canopy development. Late spring frost events may therefore provide a competitive advantage for yellow birch and American beech at the expense of sugar maple. Results from satellite remote sensing confirm that frost damage was widespread throughout the region at higher elevations ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}}500 similar to m). The frost event is estimated to have reduced gross ecosystem productivity by 70153 similar to g similar to C similar to m-2, or 714{\{}{\%}{\}} of the annual gross productivity (1061 similar to+/-similar to 82 similar to g similar to C similar to m-2) across 8753 similar to km2 of high-elevation forest. We conclude that frost events following leaf out, which are expected to become more common with climate change, may influence both forest composition and ecosystem productivity.},

	abstract = {P{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}Plant phenology is particularly sensitive to climate and a key indicator of environmental change. Globally, first flowering dates (FFDs) have advanced by several days per decade in response to recent climate warming, but, while earlier flowering should allow plant distributions to increase, a link between FFD and range changes has not been observed. Here I show for 347 species that the extent to which FFD has responded to climate warming is linked to the degree to which their relative distributions have changed over 30 yr across the British Isles. Native plant species whose phenology did not track climate change declined in distribution, whereas species that became more widespread all exhibited earlier flowering. In contrast, alien neophytes showed both a stronger phenological response to warming and a more marked increase in distribution, but no link between the two. These trends were consistent both for relative changes in the national distribution and for local abundance. At the national scale, the more recently an alien species became established in Britain, the more likely it was to increase in distribution irrespective of FFD, suggesting that recent changes in alien species distributions are decoupled from climate and driven by other factors.},

	abstract = {The effects that below-freezing temperature (frost) can have at times of year when it is unusual are an interesting ecological phenomenon that has received little attention. The physiological consequence of formation of ice crystals in plant tissue is often death of the plants, or at least of sensitive parts that can include flower buds, ovaries, and leaves. The loss of potential for sexual reproduction can have long-lasting effects on the demography of annuals and long-lived perennials, because the short-term negative effects of frosts can result in longer-term benefits through lowered populations of seed predators. The loss of host plants can have dramatic consequences for herbivores, even causing local extinctions, and the loss of just flowers can also affect populations of seed predators and their parasitoids. Frosts can cause local extinctions and influence the geographical distribution of some species. The potential for global climate change to influence the frequency and distribution of frost events is uncertain, but it seems likely that they may become more frequent in some areas and less frequent in others.},

We compared surveys of plant cover that were made in 1977 and 2006-2007 along a 2,314-m elevation gradient in Southern California's Santa Rosa Mountains. Southern California's climate warmed at the surface, the precipitation variability increased, and the amount of snow decreased during the 30-year period preceding the second survey. We found that the average elevation of the dominant plant species rose by approximately 65 m between the surveys. This shift cannot be attributed to changes in air pollution or fire frequency and appears to be a consequence of changes in regional climate.},

@article{Kikuchi2009,
	abstract = {To understand the development of cold hardiness in highbush blueberry plants (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), we investigated seasonal changes in the protein compositions of current-year and overwintered shoots. Electrophoresis using SDS-polyacrylamide gels indicated that the amounts of a few proteins increased in autumn, in association with an enhancement of cold hardiness. Of these proteins, 65- and 60-kDa proteins were confirmed to be dehydrins by western blotting. While the levels of most of the accumulated proteins decreased in April, a 27-kDa protein maintained its level in the overwintered stem during spring. The amino acid sequence deduced from a cDNA for this protein showed significant similarities with known chitinases. The stem segments from overwintered shoots sampled in July showed higher cold hardiness against sub-zero temperature than those from current-year shoots, and the bark tissue of overwintered shoots had higher cold resistance than that of current-year shoots. The 27-kDa protein (BC27) was mostly found in the bark tissue of stems. Appreciable accumulation of this protein in floral buds was not detected. The purified BC27 protein exerted a cryoprotective effect on protoplasts subjected to a freeze-thaw treatment. These results suggest that the stems of highbush blueberry develop a system of cold hardiness different from that of the buds and apices, and that the accumulation of chitinase is involved in tolerance to low temperature in winter or unseasonably low temperature in spring. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {In deciduous forests, spring leaf phenology controls the onset of numerous ecosystem functions. While most studies have focused on a single annual spring event, such as budburst, ecosystem functions like photosynthesis and transpiration increase gradually after budburst, as leaves grow to their mature size. Here, we examine the ``velocity of green-up,'' or duration between budburst and leaf maturity, in deciduous forest ecosystems of eastern North America. We use a diverse data set that includes 301 site-years of phenocam data across a range of sites, as well as 22 years of direct ground observations of individual trees and 3 years of fine-scale high-frequency aerial photography, both from Harvard Forest. We find a significant association between later start of spring and faster green-up: −{\thinspace}0.47{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.04 (slope{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}1 SE) days change in length of green-up for every day later start of spring within phenocam sites, −{\thinspace}0.31{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.06 days/day for trees under direct observation, and −{\thinspace}1.61{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.08 days/day spatially across fine-scale landscape units. To explore the climatic drivers of spring leaf development, we fit degree-day models to the observational data from Harvard Forest. We find that the default phenology parameters of the ecosystem model PnET make biased predictions of leaf initiation (39 days early) and maturity (13 days late) for red oak, while the optimized model has biases of 1 day or less. Springtime productivity predictions using optimized parameters are closer to results driven by observational data (within 1{\%}) than those of the default parameterization (17{\%} difference). Our study advances empirical understanding of the link between early and late spring phenophases and demonstrates that accurately modeling these transitions is important for simulating seasonal variation in ecosystem productivity.},

	abstract = {Analyses of climate model simulations and observations reveal that extreme cold events are likely to persist across each land-continent even under 21st-century warming scenarios. The grid-based intensity, duration and frequency of cold extreme events are calculated annually through three indices: the coldest annual consecutive three-day average of daily maximum temperature, the annual maximum of consecutive frost days, and the total number of frost days. Nine global climate models forced with a moderate greenhouse-gas emissions scenario compares the indices over 20912100 versus 19912000. The credibility of model-simulated cold extremes is evaluated through both bias scores relative to reanalysis data in the past and multi-model agreement in the future. The number of times the value of each annual index in 20912100 exceeds the decadal average of the corresponding index in 19912000 is counted. The results indicate that intensity and duration of grid-based cold extremes, when viewed as a global total, will often be as severe as current typical conditions in many regions, but the corresponding frequency does not show this persistence. While the models agree on the projected persistence of cold extremes in terms of global counts, regionally, inter-model variability and disparity in model performance tends to dominate. Our findings suggest that, despite a general warming trend, regional preparedness for extreme cold events cannot be compromised even towards the end of the century.},

We investigated the extent to which the climatic origins of populations from four live oak species (Quercus series Virentes) were associated with freezing tolerance and growth rate, and whether species fitted a model of locally adapted populations, each with narrow climatic tolerances, or of broadly adapted populations with wide climatic tolerances. * Acorns from populations of four species across a tropical-temperate gradient were grown under common tropical and temperate conditions. Growth rate, seed mass, and leaf and stem freezing traits were compared with source minimum temperatures. * Maximum growth rates under tropical conditions were negatively correlated with freezing tolerance under temperate conditions. The minimum source temperature predicted the freezing tolerance of populations under temperate conditions. The tropical species Q. oleoides was differentiated from the three temperate species, and variation among species was greater than among populations. * The trade-off between freezing tolerance and growth rate supports the range limit hypothesis. Limited variation within species indicates that the distributions of species may be driven more strongly by broad climatic factors than by highly local conditions.},

	abstract = {1.Attempts at explaining range limits of temperate tree species still rest on correlations with climatic data that lack a physiological justification. Here we present a synthesis of a multidisciplinary project that offers mechanistic explantions. Employing climatology, biogeography, dendrology, population and reproduction biology, stress physiology and phenology, we combine results from in situ elevational (Swiss Alps) and latitudinal (Alps versus Scandinavia) comparisons, from reciprocal common garden and phytotron studies for 8 European broadleaf tree species. 2.We show that unlike for low stature plants, tree canopy temperatures can be predicted from weather station data, and that low temperature extremes in winter do not explain range limits. At the current low temperature range limit, all species recruit well. Transplants revealed that the local environment rather than elevation of seed origin dominates growth and phenology. Tree ring width at the range limit is not related to season length, but to growing season temperature, with no evidence of carbon shortage. Bud break and leaf emergence in adults trees are timed in such a way that the probability of freezing damage is almost zero, with a uniform safety margin across elevations and taxa. More freezing-resistant species flush earlier than less resistant species. 3.Synthesis: we conclude that the range limits of the examined tree species are set by the interactive influence of freezing resistance in spring, phenology settings, and the time required to mature tissue. Microevolution of spring phenology compromises between demands set by freezing resistance of young, immature tissue and season length requirements related to autumnal tissue maturation.

	abstract = {Minimum temperature is assumed to be an important driver of tree species range limits. We investigated during which period of the year trees are most vulnerable to freezing damage and whether the pressure of freezing events increases with increasing elevation. We assessed the course of freezing resistance of buds and leaves from winter to summer at the upper elevational limits of eight deciduous tree species in the Swiss Alps. By reconstructing the spring phenology of these species over the last eight decades using a thermal time model, we linked freezing resistance with long-term minimum temperature data along elevational gradients. Counter-intuitively, the pressure of freeze events does not increase with elevation, but deciduous temperate tree species exhibit a constant safety margin (5-8.5 K) against damage by spring freeze events along elevational gradients, as a result of the later flushing at higher elevation. Absolute minimum temperatures in winter and summer are unlikely to critically injure trees. Our study shows that freezing temperatures in spring are the main selective pressure controlling the timing of flushing, leading to a shorter growing season at higher elevation and potentially driving species distribution limits. Such mechanistic knowledge is important to improve predictions of tree species range limits.},

@article{Lenz2016,
	abstract = {1. Within the same forest stand, temperate deciduous trees generally exhibit a distinct pattern in leaf-out timing, with some species flushing earlier than other species. This study aimed to explain the timing of leaf-out of various temperate tree species in relation to the risk of freezing damage to leaves. 2. We combined long-term series of leaf-out date (14--32 years) of five temperate tree species located in both low and high elevations in Switzerland, daily minimum temperatures recorded on the same sites and species-specific freezing resistance (LT50) of emerging leaves. We calculated temperature safety margins (the temperature difference between absolute minimum temperature during leaf-out and speciesspecific LT50 values), and date safety margins (time lag between the last day when temperature falls below species-specific LT50 values and the date of leaf-out). 3. The timing of leaf-out occurred when the probability to encounter freezing damage approaches zero, irrespective of climatic conditions (low vs. high elevation) and species (early and late flushing species). In other words, trees leaf-out precisely at the beginning of the probabilistically safe period. Interestingly, the temperature safety margins did not differ significantly between low and high elevation. Yet, the date safety margin was smaller at high elevation, presumably due to a faster increase of temperature during the leaf-out period at high elevation. 4. When species-specific freezing resistance is taken into account, the time of leaf-out converges among species towards a marginal risk of freezing damage. Thus, leaf-out time has likely evolved in a way that the risk of freezing damage is minimized over a large spectrum of climatic conditions. Species with a small safety margin against freezing temperature, like Fagus sylvatica, appear to employ photoperiod co-control of spring phenology, whereas species with a large safety margin depend largely on temperature for the right timing of leaf-out. 5. Our results offer a new avenue to explain the differences in leaf-out timing among cooccurring tree species. They further suggest that in a warming climate, tree species can expand their distribution range to the extent their phenology matches the stochasticity of freezing temperatures in spring.},

	abstract = {Near-record warmth over much of the United States during March 2007 promoted early growth of crops and vegetation. A widespread arctic air outbreak followed in early April, resulting in extensive agricultural losses over much of the south-central and southeastern US. This 'false spring' event also resulted in widespread damage to newly grown tissues of native deciduous forest species, shown by previous researchers to have had measurable effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle. The current study reconstructed the historical occurrence of false springs over most of the southeastern quarter of the conterminous US (32--39{\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}N; 75--98{\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}W) from 1901 to 2007 using daily maximum and minimum temperature records from 176 stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network database, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations. A false spring index was derived that examined the timing of the start of the growing season (SGS), or leaf emergence, relative to the timing of a potentially damaging last hard freeze (minimum temperature ≤ − 2.2 {\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}C). SGS was modeled for the domain by combining EVI data with ground-based temperature 'degree day' calculations reflecting the rate of springtime warming. No significant area-wide, long-term SGS trend was found; however, over much of a contiguous region stretching from Mississippi eastward to the Carolinas, the timing of the last hard freeze was found to occur significantly later, this change occurring along with increased frequency of false springs. Earlier last hard freeze dates and decreased frequency of false springs were found over much of the northwestern part of the study region, including Arkansas and southern Missouri.},

@article{Menzel2015,
	abstract = {Damage by late spring frost is a risk deciduous trees have to cope with in order to optimize the length of their growing season. The timing of spring phenological development plays a crucial role, not only at the species level, but also at the population and individual level, since fresh new leaves are especially vulnerable. For the pronounced late spring frost in May 2011 in Germany, we studied the individual leaf development of 35 deciduous trees (mainly European beech Fagus sylvatica L.) at a mountainous forest site in the Bayerischer Wald National Park using repeated digital photographs. Analyses of the time series of greenness by a novel Bayesian multiple change point approach mostly revealed five change points which almost perfectly matched the expected break points in leaf development: (i) start of the first greening between day of the year (DOY) 108--119 (mean 113), (ii) end of greening, and (iii) visible frost damage after the frost on the night of May 3rd/4th (DOY 123/124), (iv) re-sprouting 19--38 days after the frost, and (v) full maturity around DOY 178 (166--184) when all beech crowns had fully recovered. Since frost damage was nearly 100{\%}, individual susceptibility did not depend on the timing of first spring leaf unfolding. However, we could identify significant patterns in fitness linked to an earlier start of leaf unfolding. Those individuals that had an earlier start of greening during the first flushing period had a shorter period of recovery and started the second greening earlier. Thus, phenological timing triggered the speed of recovery from such an extreme event. The maximum greenness achieved, however, did not vary with leaf unfolding dates. Two mountain ashes (Sorbus aucuparia L.) were not affected by the low temperatures of -5$\,^{\circ}$C. Time series analysis of webcam pictures can thus improve process-based knowledge and provide valuable insights into the link between phenological variation, late spring frost damage, and recovery within one stand.},

Awareness of the growing impact of human activities on the environment led to scientific and political initiatives at the global level, beginning in the 1970s. The Perth conference in 2010 has offered an opportunity to both look back on these developments and explore the future of the world's mountains in a time of rapidly growing ``global change'' problems and processes.

@article{Moorcroft2001,
	abstract = {The problem of scale has been a critical impediment to incorporating important fine-scale processes into global ecosystem models. Our knowledge of fine-scale physiological and ecological processes comes from a variety of measurements, ranging from forest plot inventories to remote sensing, made at spatial resolutions considerably smaller than the large scale at which global ecosystem models are defined. In this paper, we describe a new individual-based, terrestrial biosphere model, which we label the ecosystem demography model (ED). We then introduce a general method for scaling stochastic individual-based models of ecosystem dynamics (gap models) such as ED to large scales. The method accounts for the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within an ecosystem caused by stochastic disturbance events, operating at scales down to individual canopy-tree-sized gaps. By conditioning appropriately on the occurrence of these events, we derive a size- and age-structured (SAS) approximation for the first moment of the stochastic ecosystem model. With this approximation, it is possible to make predictions about the large scales of interest from a description of the fine-scale physiological and population-dynamic processes without simulating the fate of every plant individually. We use the SAS approximation to implement our individual-based biosphere model over South America from 15$\,^{\circ}$ N to 15$\,^{\circ}$ S, showing that the SAS equations are accurate across a range of environmental conditions and resulting ecosystem types. We then compare the predictions of the biosphere model to regional data and to intensive data at specific sites. Analysis of the model at these sites illustrates the importance of fine-scale heterogeneity in governing large-scale ecosystem function, showing how population and community-level processes influence ecosystem composition and structure, patterns of aboveground carbon accumulation, and net ecosystem production.},

	abstract = {Recent shifts in phenology are the best documented biological response to current anthropogenic climate change, yet remain poorly understood from a functional point of view. Prevailing analyses are phenomenological and approximate, only correlating temperature records to imprecise records of phenological events. To advance our understanding of phenological responses to climate change, we developed, calibrated, and validated process-based models of leaf unfolding for 22 North American tree species. Using daily meteorological data predicted by two scenarios (A2: +3.2 {\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}C and B2: +1 {\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}C) from the HadCM3 GCM, we predicted and compared range-wide shifts of leaf unfolding in the 20th and 21st centuries for each species. Model predictions suggest that climate change will affect leaf phenology in almost all species studied, with an average advancement during the 21st century of 5.0 days in the A2 scenario and 9.2 days in the B2 scenario. Our model also suggests that lack of sufficient chilling temperatures to break bud dormancy will decrease the rate of advancement in leaf unfolding date during the 21st century for many species. Some temperate species may even have years with abnormal budburst due to insufficient chilling. Species fell into two groups based on their sensitivity to climate change: (1) species that consistently had a greater advance in their leaf unfolding date with increasing latitude and (2) species in which the advance in leaf unfolding differed from the center to the northern vs. southern margins of their range. At the interspecific level, we predicted that early-leafing species tended to show a greater advance in leaf unfolding date than late-leafing species; and that species with larger ranges tend to show stronger phenological changes. These predicted changes in phenology have significant implications for the frost susceptibility of species, their interspecific relationships, and their distributional shifts.},

@article{Nolin2011a,
	abstract = {From both social and environmental perspectives, water is the main connection between highland and lowland processes in mountain watersheds: Water flows downhill while human impacts flow uphill. For example, in the Oregon Cascades mountain range, geology, vegetation, and climate influence the hydrologic connections within watersheds. Geology determines which watersheds are surface runoff-dominated and which are groundwater-dominated. In this Mediterranean climate with dry summers, surface runoff watersheds will consistently experience near-zero late summer discharge, so declining snowpacks will have little effect on low flows. This contrasts with groundwater-dominated watersheds, where a shift from snow to rain or a decline in precipitation will reduce recharge, thereby reducing late summer groundwater contributions to streamflow. Earlier snowmelt causes forests to transpire earlier, resulting in decreased springtime streamflow. Reduced snowpacks lead to soil moisture stress, making forests more vulnerable to extensive wildfires and affecting the lifespan and composition of forests. Monitoring and quantifying these complex linkages and feedbacks require appropriate measurement networks. Sampling strategies often use watershed typology to identify where measurements should be focused. Such an approach should include not only established watershed classification parameters such as topology and geology but also interannual climate variability and land cover. As concerns of water scarcity and vulnerability move to the forefront, our watershed classifications should be extended to include ecosystem and social-ecological parameters. An integrated and agent-based modeling scheme called Envision has been developed to simulate alternative future landscapes at the watershed scale. Using fully coupled models of hydrology, ecosystems, and socioeconomics, decision-makers can simulate the effects of policy decisions in conjunction with other climate forcing, land use change, and economic disturbances. To understand the combined impacts of climate change and humans on water in mountain watersheds, researchers must develop integrated monitoring and modeling systems that explicitly include connections across eco-hydrologic and social-ecological systems.},

@article{Peterson2008,
	abstract = {Detailed homogeneity assessments of daily weather observing station data from Canada, the United States, and Mexico enabled analysis of changes in North American extremes starting in 1950. The approach used a number of indices derived from the daily data, primarily based on the number of days per year that temperature or precipitation observations were above or below percentile thresholds. Station level indices were gridded to produce North American area-averaged time series. The results indicated that the increase in the number of days exceeding the 90th percentile is about the same magnitude as the decrease in the number of days below the 10th percentile. Analysis of extremes farther out on the tails of the distribution (e.g., 95th and 97.5th percentiles) reveals changes very similar to the 90th and 10th percentiles. Annual extreme lowest temperatures are warming faster than annual extreme highest temperatures when the index assessed is the actual temperature, but cold and hot extremes are changing about the same when examined on a normalized basis. On the basis of several measures, heavy precipitation has been increasing over the last half century, and the average amount of precipitation falling on days with precipitation has also been increasing. These observed changes since the late 1960s, decrease in cold extremes, increases in warm extremes, and increases in heavy precipitation, are consistent with a warming planet},

	abstract = {Climate warming fosters an earlier spring green-up that may bring potential benefits to agricultural systems. However, advances in green-up timing may leave early stage vegetation growth vulnerable to cold damage when hard freezes follow green-up resulting in a false spring. Spatiotemporal patterns of green-up dates, last spring freezes, and false springs were examined across the contiguous United States from 1920 to 2013. Results indicate widespread earlier green-up and last spring freeze dates over the period. Observed changes in these dates were asymmetric with the last spring freeze date advancing to earlier in the year relative to green-up date. Although regionally variable, these changes resulted in a reduction in false springs, notably over the past 20 years, except across the intermountain western United States where the advance in green-up timing outpaced that of the last spring freeze. A sensitivity experiment shows that observed decreases in false springs are consistent with a warming climate.},

	abstract = {Leafing-out of woody plants begins the growing season in temperate forests and is one of the most important drivers of ecosystem processes. There is substantial variation in the timing of leaf-out, both within and among species, but the leaf development of almost all temperate tree and shrub species is highly sensitive to temperature. As a result, leaf-out times of temperate forests are valuable for observing the effects of climate change. Analysis of phenology data from around the world indicates that leaf-out is generally earlier in warmer years than in cooler years and that the onset of leaf-out has advanced in many locations. Changes in the timing of leaf-out will affect carbon sequestration, plant-animal interactions, and other essential ecosystem processes. The development of remote sensing methods has expanded the scope of leaf-out monitoring from the level of an individual plant or forest to an entire region. Meanwhile, historical data have informed modeling and experimental studies addressing questions about leaf-out timing. For most species, onset of leaf-out will continue to advance, although advancement may be slowed for some species because of unmet chilling requirements. More information is needed to reduce the uncertainty in predicting the timing of future spring onset.},

	abstract = {To elucidate climate-driven changes in leaf-out phenology and their implications for species invasions, we observed and experimentally manipulated leaf out of invasive and native woody plants in Concord, MA, USA. Using observations collected by Henry David Thoreau (1852-1860) and our own observations (2009-2013), we analyzed changes in leaf-out timing and sensitivity to temperature for 43 woody plant species. We experimentally tested winter chilling requirements of 50 species by exposing cut branches to warm indoor temperatures (22{\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}C) during the winter and spring of 2013. Woody species are now leafing out an average of 18 d earlier than they did in the 1850s, and are advancing at a rate of 5 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 1 d {\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}C(-1) . Functional groups differ significantly in the duration of chilling they require to leaf out: invasive shrubs generally have weaker chilling requirements than native shrubs and leaf out faster in the laboratory and earlier in the field; native trees have the strongest chilling requirements. Our results suggest that invasive shrub species will continue to have a competitive advantage as the climate warms, because native plants are slower to respond to warming spring temperatures and, in the future, may not meet their chilling requirements.},

	abstract = {Ungulate communities are changing at a global scale, which is increasing the need for landscape scale quantification of ungulate impacts on plant communities. To achieve robust monitoring across variable landscapes, managers need quick and reliable indicators for assessing ungulate impacts. Our goal was to evaluate two direct (meristem removal, defoliation) and two indirect methods (fecal counts, camera counts) for evaluating ungulate activity on forest regeneration after fire. We examined the relationships between measures of browse activity (meristem removal, defoliation) of aspen with ungulate community estimates (fecal and camera counts) as a function of variation in physiographic conditions across the study sites. Measurements were made in belt transects at 28 sites across three fires that burned in National Forests in Utah in 2012. Aspen height was best predicted by a model with meristem removal, terrain ruggedness, aspect, and year. Mean aspen height was 5 cm lower for every 10% increase in meristem removal an effect that increased over time. We found moderate correlation between the year and percent defoliation interaction and aspen density. Percent defoliation was related to reduced aspen density in the 2nd and 3rd years but not in the 1st year. Results demonstrated that meristem removal is correlated closely with ocular estimates of defoliation (r2 = 0.83), ungulate abundance using fecal counts (r2 = 0.65) and camera counts (r2 = 0.63). Fecal counts and camera counts also correlated well with each other (r2 = 0.74). Estimates of meristem removal in our study suggest that 75% browse of apical meristems is an important threshold for successful aspen height growth and 50% defoliation for aspen regeneration density. Our study highlights the strengths of measurements of meristem removal and defoliation to predict ungulate effects on forest recruitment potential.},

	abstract = {Freeze injury is one of the main limiting factors to crop production and distribution of horticultural crops. Despite the numerous research efforts devoted to reduce freezing injury, it still accounts for greater losses of fruits and vegetables than any other environmental or biological hazard and the ultimate causes determining cold hardiness remain uncertain. In temperate climates, important damages on deciduous fruit trees are produced in buds, flowers and developing fruits after dormancy and losses due to frosts during bloom are usually more important than those due to low winter temperatures. The information available on the influence of late spring frosts on reproductive organs of deciduous fruit trees in temperate climates is reviewed. The freezing process is examined, paying attention to how subsequent frost damage is caused at the cellular level as well as its anatomical and morphological consequences in flowers and fruits. The flower hardiness response is evaluated in terms of genotype, phenology and a number of physiological aspects as the formation of ice nucleation, moisture content and nutritive status. Finally, new perspectives are explored. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{Savolainen2007,
	abstract = { Populations are locally adapted when populations have the highest relative fitness at their home sites, and lower fitness in other parts of the range. Results from the extensive experimental plantations of populations of forest trees from different parts of the range show that populations can survive and grow in broad areas outside the home site. However, intra- and interspecific competition limit the distribution of genotypes. For populations from large parts of the range, relative fitness, compared with the local population, is often highest at the home site. At the edges of the range, this local adaptation may break down. The extent of local adaptation is determined by the balance between gene flow and selection. Genetic differentiation and strong natural selection occur over a range of tens or hundreds of kilometers, but reliable measurements of gene flow are available only for much shorter distances. Current models of spatially varying selection could be made more realistic by the incorporation of strong selection and isolation-by-distance characteristic of tree populations. Many studies suggest that most variation in adaptive traits is based on loci with small effects. Association genetics methods and improved genomic resources are useful for the identification of the loci responsible for this variation. The potential for adaptation to current climate change depends on genetic variation and dispersal and establishment rates. },

	abstract = {The onset of the spring season is a phenomenon associated with systematic changes in the land surface-atmosphere interface, which will likely be modified by climate change. A measure of this complex feature, or 'spring index', should reflect the variations in both weather events and plant physiology usually identified with mid-latitutde spring. In this study, variables representing plant phenology, synoptic weather system frequency, surface temperature-thickness relationship 'breaks' (difference between surface maximum temperature and thickness-derived layer mean temperature), and last freeze date (0.degree. C or lower) are compared and examined as components of a comprehensive measure of the onset of spring. Two small networks of stations in the eastern and central United States are used as test data over the period 1961 to 1980. The phenology-synoptic weather component (P-SW), derived from regression-based models of first leaf emergence, has the strongest relationship with other measures, and can be produced from generally available surface data. This component is proposed as a first approximation of a comprehensive spring index, suitable for analyzing the impact of past and future climate changes on the onset of spring.},

	abstract = {Onset of the growing season in mid-latitudes is a period of rapid transition, which includes heightened interaction between living organisms and the lower atmosphere. Phenological events (seasonal plant and animal activity driven by environmental factors), such as first leaf appearance or flower bloom in plants, can serve as convenient markers to monitor the progression of this yearly shift, and assess longer-term change resulting from climate variations. We examined spring seasons across North America over the 1900-1997 period using modelled and actual lilac phenological data. Regional differences were detected, as well as an average 5-6 day advance toward earlier springs, over a 35-year period from 1959-1993. Driven by seasonally warmer temperatures, this modification agrees with earlier bird nesting times, and corresponds to a comparable advance of spring plant phenology described in Europe. These results also align with trends towards longer growing seasons, reported by recent carbon dioxide and satellite studies. North American spring warming is strongest regionally in the northwest and northeast portions. Meanwhile, slight autumn cooling is apparent in the central USA.

	abstract = {National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-series satellites, carrying advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) sensors, have allowed moderate resolution (1 km) measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to be collected from the Earth's land surfaces for over 20 years. Across the conterminous USA, a readily accessible and decade-long data set is now available to study many aspects of vegetation activity in this region. One feature, the onset of deciduous plant growth at the start of the spring season (SOS) is of special interest, as it appears to be crucial for accurate computation of several important biospheric processes, and a sensitive measure of the impacts of global change.In this study, satellite-derived SOS dates produced by the delayed moving average (DMA) and seasonal midpoint NDVI (SMN) methods, and modelled surface phenology (spring indices, SI) were compared at widespread deciduous forest and mixed woodland sites during 1990-93 and 1995-99, and these three measures were also matched to native species bud-break data collected at the Harvard Forest (Massachusetts) over the same time period. The results show that both SOS methods are doing a modestly accurate job of tracking the general pattern of surface phenology, but highlight the temporal limitations of biweekly satellite data. Specifically, at deciduous forest sites: (1) SMN SOS dates are close in time to SI first bloom dates (average bias of +0.74 days), whereas DMA SOS dates are considerably earlier (average bias of -41.24 days) and also systematically earlier in late spring than in early spring; (2) SMN SOS tracks overall yearly trends in deciduous forests somewhat better than DMA SOS, but with larger average error (MAEs 8.64 days and 7.37 days respectively); and (3) error in both SOS techniques varies considerably by year.

	abstract = {Recent warming of Northern Hemisphere (NH) land is well documented and typically greater in winter/spring than other seasons. Physical environment responses to warming have been reported, but not details of large-area temperate growing season impacts, or consequences for ecosystems and agriculture. To date, hemispheric-scale measurements of biospheric changes have been confined to remote sensing. However, these studies did not provide detailed data needed for many investigations. Here, we show that a suite of modeled and derived measures (produced from daily maximum--minimum temperatures) linking plant development (phenology) with its basic climatic drivers provide a reliable and spatially extensive method for monitoring general impacts of global warming on the start of the growing season. Results are consistent with prior smaller area studies, confirming a nearly universal quicker onset of early spring warmth (spring indices (SI) first leaf date, −1.2 days decade−1), late spring warmth (SI first bloom date, −1.0 days decade−1; last spring day below 5{\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}C, −1.4 days decade−1), and last spring freeze date (−1.5 days decade−1) across most temperate NH land regions over the 1955--2002 period.However, dynamics differ among major continental areas with North American first leaf and last freeze date changes displaying a complex spatial relationship. Europe presents a spatial pattern of change, with western continental areas showing last freeze dates getting earlier faster, some central areas having last freeze and first leaf dates progressing at about the same pace, while in portions of Northern and Eastern Europe first leaf dates are getting earlier faster than last freeze dates. Across East Asia last freeze dates are getting earlier faster than first leaf dates.},

@article{Schwartz2010,
	abstract = {Measuring the onset of deciduous tree leaf flush and subsequent development during the spring season in temperate climates can be accomplished using multiple ground and satellite-based techniques. Although all these measurements are valid (i.e. record a real characteristic related to plant development), they typically are poorly inter- related due to incompatible levels of spatial representation and differing methodologies. Given recent and likely future impacts of climate change on spring leaf development, the need to reconstruct past patterns, and the lack of standardised vegetation change measurements around the world, more work is needed to determine the relationships among the various measures, and the degree to which they may serve as substitutes for each other. In this article, we use observations and measurements at two phenology `super-sites' in eastern North America and four other supporting sites to evaluate the relationships among multiple spring leaf development measures, and explore strategies to standardise their intercomparison. The results show infrequent significant correlations among 10 satellite-derived `start of season' (SOS) measures (which suggests they are often not detecting the same phenomena), along with more common significant correlations among six ground phenology measures. However, when ground phenology and satellite-derived SOS are compared, there are few significant correlations, even at sites with extensive native species phenology available. Modelled phenology, based on daily temperature data (Spring Indices First Bloom date) does as well as any of the direct native species measures, and is well suited to facilitate intercomparisons. In order to effectively compare ground-based and satellite-derived SOS measures, approaches that use limited numbers of individual plants face considerable challenges. Given that satellite-derived measures are areal and at a scale of 250 m and larger, we suggest collecting ground phenology data at the same areal scale in order to make effective comparisons.},

@article{St.Clair2009,
	abstract = {In May 2007, a widespread frost event defoliated much of Utah's high elevation aspen. About 5 weeks later, the frost-defoliated aspen produced a second leaf flush. The objective of this study was to characterize changes in leaf morphology and function in re-flush leaves following frost defoliation. Leaf size and thickness, photosynthesis, carbohydrate and nutrient status, and defense chemistry (phenolic glycosides and condensed tannins) were measured in first and second flush leaves. The second flush leaves produced two different morphological responses depending on frost damage severity. Severe frost damage was characterized by patchy canopy re-flushing with leaves that were on average four times larger than the first flush leaves. Moderate frost damage produced full canopy flushes with second flush leaves that were typically smaller than the first flush leaves. The second flush leaves tended to be thicker, and had significantly lower nutrient and sucrose concentrations, but had equal or higher rates of photosynthesis. These leaves showed a general pattern of defense chemistry induction with phenolic glycosides and condensed tannins increasing two- to threefold. Some of the changes in leaf morphology and defense chemistry observed in second flush leaves in 2007 persisted in leaves produced in the following year. We hypothesize that defense chemistry induction following abiotic defoliation serves as insurance against secondary defoliation events by herbivores that may further deplete nutrient and carbohydrate leaf resources below threshold points that are critical for physiological function. Resource dilution and allocation to secondary defense may place constraints on growth capacity.},

	abstract = {Biome-BGC is a computer program that estimates fluxes and storage of energy, water, carbon, and nitrogen for the vegetation and soil components of terrestrial ecosystems. The primary model purpose is to study global and regional interactions between climate, disturbance, and biogeochemical cycles.Biome-BGC represents physical and biological processes that control fluxes of energy and mass. These processes include: New leaf growth and old leaf litterfall Sunlight interception by leaves and penetration to the ground Precipitation routing to leaves and soil Snow accumulation and melting Drainage and runoff of soil water Evaporation of water from soil and wet leaves Transpiration of soil water through leaf stomata Photosynthetic fixation of carbon from CO2 in the air Uptake of nitrogen from the soil Distribution of carbon and nitrogen to growing plant parts Decomposition of fresh plant litter and old soil organic matter Plant mortality Fire The model uses a daily time-step. This means that each flux is estimated for a one-day period. Between days, the program updates its memory of the mass stored in different components of the vegetation, litter, and soil. Weather is the most important control on vegetation processes. Flux estimates in Biome-BGC depend strongly on daily weather conditions. Model behavior over time depends on climate--the history of these weather conditions.A companion file with more information about Biome-BGC and its components is available at ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/model{\_}archive/BIOME{\_}BGC/biome{\_}bgc{\_}4.1.1/comp/BiomeBGC{\_}v411{\_}release.pdf .Biome-BGC, Version 4.1.1 was developed and is maintained by the  Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group, School of Forestry, The University of Montana, Missoula, Montana, USA.

@article{Vavrus2006,
	abstract = {Climate model output is used to analyze the behavior of extreme cold-air outbreaks (CAOs) under recent and future climatic conditions. The study uses daily output from seven GCMs run under late-twentieth century and projected twenty-first century radiative conditions (SRES A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario). We define a CAO as an occurrence of two or more consecutive days during which the local mean daily surface air temperature is at least two standard deviations below the local wintertime mean temperature. In agreement with observations, the models generally simulate modern CAOs most frequently over western North America and Europe and least commonly over the Arctic. These favored regions for CAOs are located downstream from preferred locations of atmospheric blocking. Future projections indicate that CAOs---defined with respect to late-twentieth century climatic conditions---will decline in frequency by 50 to 100{\{}{\%}{\}} in most of the Northern Hemisphere during the twenty-first century. Certain regions, however, show relatively small changes and others actually experience more CAOs in the future, due to atmospheric circulation changes and internal variability that counter the thermodynamic tendency from greenhouse forcing. These areas generally experience greater near-surface wind flow from the north or the continent during the twenty-first century and/or are especially prone to atmospheric blocking events. Simulated reductions in CAOs are smallest in western North America, the North Atlantic, and in southern regions of Europe and Asia. The Eurasian pattern is driven by a strong tendency for the models to produce sea-level pressure (SLP) increases in the vicinity of the Mediterranean Sea (intermodel mean of 3 hPa), causing greater advection of continental air from northern and central Asia, while the muted change over western North America is due to enhanced ridging along the west coast and the increased frequency of blocking events. The North Atlantic response is consistent with a slowdown of the thermohaline circulation, which either damps the warming regionally or results in a cooler mean climate in the vicinity of Greenland.

	abstract = {Phenological events, such as the initiation and the end of seasonal growth, are thought to be under strong evolutionary control because of their influence on tree fitness. Although numerous studies highlighted genetic differentiation in phenology among populations from contrasting climates, it remains unclear whether local adaptation could restrict phenological plasticity in response to current warming. Seedling populations of seven deciduous tree species from high and low elevations in the Swiss Alps were investigated in eight common gardens located along two elevational gradients from 400 to 1,700 m. We addressed the following questions: are there genetic differentiations in phenology between populations from low and high elevations, and are populations from the upper elevational limit of a species' distribution able to respond to increasing temperature to the same extent as low-elevation populations? Genetic variation of leaf unfolding date between seedlings from low and high populations was detected in six out of seven tree species. Except for beech, populations from high elevations tended to flush later than populations from low elevations, emphasizing that phenology is likely to be under evolutionary pressure. Furthermore, seedlings from high elevation exhibited lower phenological plasticity to temperature than low-elevation provenances. This difference in phenological plasticity may reflect the opposing selective forces involved (i.e. a trade-off between maximizing growing season length and avoiding frost damages). Nevertheless, environmental effects were much stronger than genetic effects, suggesting a high phenological plasticity to enable tree populations to track ongoing climate change, which includes the risk of tracking unusually warm springs followed by frost.},

Our study highlights that the timing of spring phenology has evolved in such a way that it minimizes the risk of freeze damage according to the species-specific LT50. Early flushing species are among the most freezing-resistant species during flushing, whereas late flushing species are among the least resistant. We conclude that for the examined species the species-specific freezing resistance during leaf emergence could be extracted from either adult or juvenile trees, as long as it is estimated at a same phenological stage},

	abstract = {Temperate climates are defined by distinct temperature seasonality with large and often unpredictable weather during any of the four seasons. To thrive in such climates, trees have to withstand a cold winter and the stochastic occurrence of freeze events during any time of the year. The physiological mechanisms trees adopt to escape, avoid, and tolerate freezing temperatures include a cold acclimation in autumn, a dormancy period during winter (leafless in deciduous trees), and the maintenance of a certain freezing tolerance during dehardening in early spring. The change from one phase to the next is mediated by complex interactions between temperature and photoperiod. This review aims at providing an overview of the interplay between phenology of leaves and species-specific freezing resistance. First, we address the long-term evolutionary responses that enabled temperate trees to tolerate certain low temperature extremes. We provide evidence that short term acclimation of freezing resistance plays a crucial role both in dormant and active buds, including re-acclimation to cold conditions following warm spells. This ability declines to almost zero during leaf emergence. Second, we show that the risk that native temperate trees encounter freeze injuries is low and is confined to spring and underline that this risk might be altered by climate warming depending on species-specific phenological responses to environmental cues.},

	abstract = {Abstract Increasing temperatures should facilitate the poleward movement of species distributions through a variety of processes, including increasing the growing season length. However, in temperate and boreal latitudes, temperature is not the only cue used by trees to determine seasonality, as changes in photoperiod provide a more consistent, reliable annual signal of seasonality than temperature. Here, we discuss how day length may limit the ability of tree species to respond to climate warming in situ, focusing on the implications of photoperiodic sensing for extending the growing season and affecting plant phenology and growth, as well as the potential role of photoperiod in controlling carbon uptake and water fluxes in forests. We also review whether there are patterns across plant functional types (based on successional strategy, xylem anatomy and leaf morphology) in their sensitivity to photoperiod that we can use to predict which species or groups might be more successful in migrating as the climate warms, or may be more successfully used for forestry and agriculture through assisted migration schemes.},

The extent to which flowering-time response to temperature is shared among closely related species might have important consequences for community-wide patterns of species loss under rapid climate change. Henry David Thoreau initiated a dataset of the Concord, Massachusetts, flora that spans approximately 150 years and provides information on changes in species abundance and flowering time. When these data are analyzed in a phylogenetic context, they indicate that change in abundance is strongly correlated with flowering-time response. Species that do not respond to temperature have decreased greatly in abundance, and include among others anemones and buttercups [Ranunculaceae pro parte (p.p.)], asters and campanulas (Asterales), bluets (Rubiaceae p.p.), bladderworts (Lentibulariaceae), dogwoods (Cornaceae), lilies (Liliales), mints (Lamiaceae p.p.), orchids (Orchidaceae), roses (Rosaceae p.p.), saxifrages (Saxifragales), and violets (Malpighiales). Because flowering-time response traits are shared among closely related species, our findings suggest that climate change has affected and will likely continue to shape the phylogenetically biased pattern of species loss in Thoreau's woods.},

	abstract = {Warming experiments are increasingly relied on to estimate plant responses to global climate change. For experiments to provide meaningful predictions of future responses, they should reflect the empirical record of responses to temperature variability and recent warming, including advances in the timing of flowering and leafing. We compared phenology (the timing of recurring life history events) in observational studies and warming experiments spanning four continents and 1,634 plant species using a common measure of temperature sensitivity (change in days per degree Celsius). We show that warming experiments underpredict advances in the timing of flowering and leafing by 8.5-fold and 4.0-fold, respectively, compared with long-term observations. For species that were common to both study types, the experimental results did not match the observational data in sign or magnitude. The observational data also showed that species that flower earliest in the spring have the highest temperature sensitivities, but this trend was not reflected in the experimental data. These significant mismatches seem to be unrelated to the study length or to the degree of manipulated warming in experiments. The discrepancy between experiments and observations, however, could arise from complex interactions among multiple drivers in the observational data, or it could arise from remediable artefacts in the experiments that result in lower irradiance and drier soils, thus dampening the phenological responses to manipulated warming. Our results introduce uncertainty into ecosystem models that are informed solely by experiments and suggest that responses to climate change that are predicted using such models should be re-evaluated.},

	abstract = {Two fundamental axes -- space and time -- shape ecological systems. Over the last 30 years spatial ecology has developed as an integrative, multidisciplinary science that has improved our under-standing of the ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation and loss. We argue that acceler-ating climate change -- the effective manipulation of time by humans -- has generated a current need to build an equivalent framework for temporal ecology. Climate change has at once pressed ecologists to understand and predict ecological dynamics in non-stationary environments, while also challenged fundamental assumptions of many concepts, models and approaches. However, similarities between space and time, especially related issues of scaling, provide an outline for improving ecological models and forecasting of temporal dynamics, while the unique attributes of time, particularly its emphasis on events and its singular direction, highlight where new approaches are needed. We emphasise how a renewed, interdisciplinary focus on time would coa-lesce related concepts, help develop new theories and methods and guide further data collection. The next challenge will be to unite predictive frameworks from spatial and temporal ecology to build robust forecasts of when and where environmental change will pose the largest threats to species and ecosystems, as well as identifying the best opportunities for conservation.},

	abstract = {In recent years, research in invasion biology has focused increasing attention on understanding the role of phenology in shaping plant invasions. Multiple studies have found non-native species that tend to flower distinctly early or late in the growing season, advance more with warming or have shifted earlier with climate change compared with native species. This growing body of literature has focused on patterns of phenological differences, but there is a need now for mechanistic studies of how phenology contributes to invasions. To do this, however, requires understanding how phenology fits within complex functional trait relationships. Towards this goal, we review recent literature linking phenology with other functional traits, and discuss the role of phenology in mediating how plants experience disturbance and stress-via climate, herbivory and competition-across the growing season. Because climate change may alter the timing and severity of stress and disturbance in many systems, it could provide novel opportunities for invasion-depending upon the dominant climate controller of the system, the projected climate change, and the traits of native and non-native species. Based on our current understanding of plant phenological and growth strategies-especially rapid growing, early-flowering species versus later-flowering species that make slower-return investments in growth-we project optimal periods for invasions across three distinct systems under current climate change scenarios. Research on plant invasions and phenology within this predictive framework would provide a more rigorous test of what drives invader success, while at the same time testing basic plant ecological theory. Additionally, extensions could provide the basis to model how ecosystem processes may shift in the future with continued climate change.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in food web ecology highlight that most real food webs (1) represent an interplay between producer and detritus-based webs and, (2) are governed by consumers which are rampant omnivores-feeding on varied prey across trophic levels and resource channels. A possible avenue to unify these advances comes from models demonstrating that predators feeding on distinctly different channels may stabilize food webs. Empirical studies suggest many consumers engage in such behavior by feeding on prey items from both living-autotroph (green) and detritus-based (brown) webs-what we term 'multi-channel feeding'-yet we know little about how common such feeding is across systems and trophic levels, or its effect on system stability. Considering 23 empirical webs, we find that multi-channel feeding is equally common across terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems, with {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}50{\{}{\%}{\}} of consumers classified as multi-channel consumers.

Climate change will also have environmental and social impacts that will likely increase uncertainty in water supplies and agricultural production for human populations across Asia. A common understanding of climate change needs to be developed through regional and local-scale research so that mitigation and adaptation strategies can be identified and implemented. The challenges brought about by climate change in the Greater Himalayas can only be addressed through increased regional collaboration in scientific research and policy making.},

	abstract = {Climate change has caused advances in spring phases of many plant species. Theoretically, however, strong warming in winter could slow the fulfillment of chilling requirements, which may delay spring phenology. This phenomenon should be particularly pronounced in regions that are experiencing rapid temperature increases and are characterized by highly temperature-responsive vegetation. To test this hypothesis, we used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ratio method to determine the beginning, end, and length of the growing season of meadow and steppe vegetation of the Tibetan Plateau in Western China between 1982 and 2006. We then correlated observed phenological dates with monthly temperatures for the entire period on record. For both vegetation types, spring phenology initially advanced, but started retreating in the mid-1990s in spite of continued warming. Together with an advancing end of the growing season for steppe vegetation, this led to a shortening of the growing period. Partial least-squares regression indicated that temperatures in both winter and spring had strong effects on spring phenology. Although warm springs led to an advance of the growing season, warm conditions in winter caused a delay of the spring phases. This delay appeared to be related to later fulfillment of chilling requirements. Because most plants from temperate and cold climates experience a period of dormancy in winter, it seems likely that similar effects occur in other environments. Continued warming may strengthen this effect and attenuate or even reverse the advancing trend in spring phenology that has dominated climate-change responses of plants thus far.},

	abstract = {Frost in late spring causes severe ecosystem damage in temperate and boreal regions. We here analyze late-spring frost occurrences between 1959 and 2017 and woody species{\textquoteright} resistance strategies to forecast forest vulnerability under climate change. Leaf-out phenology and leaf-freezing resistance data come from up to 1,500 species cultivated in common gardens. The greatest increase in leaf-damaging spring frost has occurred in Europe and East Asia, where species are more vulnerable to spring frost than in North America. The data imply that 35 and 26\% of Europe{\textquoteright}s and Asia{\textquoteright}s forests are increasingly threatened by frost damage, while this is only true for 10\% of North America. Phenological strategies that helped trees tolerate past frost frequencies will thus be increasingly mismatched to future conditionsLate-spring frosts (LSFs) affect the performance of plants and animals across the world{\textquoteright}s temperate and boreal zones, but despite their ecological and economic impact on agriculture and forestry, the geographic distribution and evolutionary impact of these frost events are poorly understood. Here, we analyze LSFs between 1959 and 2017 and the resistance strategies of Northern Hemisphere woody species to infer trees{\textquoteright} adaptations for minimizing frost damage to their leaves and to forecast forest vulnerability under the ongoing changes in frost frequencies. Trait values on leaf-out and leaf-freezing resistance come from up to 1,500 temperate and boreal woody species cultivated in common gardens. We find that areas in which LSFs are common, such as eastern North America, harbor tree species with cautious (late-leafing) leaf-out strategies. Areas in which LSFs used to be unlikely, such as broad-leaved forests and shrublands in Europe and Asia, instead harbor opportunistic tree species (quickly reacting to warming air temperatures). LSFs in the latter regions are currently increasing, and given species{\textquoteright} innate resistance strategies, we estimate that \~{}35\% of the European and \~{}26\% of the Asian temperate forest area, but only \~{}10\% of the North American, will experience increasing late-frost damage in the future. Our findings reveal region-specific changes in the spring-frost risk that can inform decision-making in land management, forestry, agriculture, and insurance policy.},
